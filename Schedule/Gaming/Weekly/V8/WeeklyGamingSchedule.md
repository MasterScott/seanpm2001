# Gaming schedule (weekly)

**Origin:** On Saturday, October 24th 2020, I had to set a schedule to limit my gaming times. I went on a hiatus that lasted over half the month, and then began to return to weekly games, as I was already overloaded with the previous schedule with just 60% of the games.

I have decided to split non-daily games into time slots on certain days. My new limit is 0.5-4.5 hours of gaming a day, 1 hour limit on shooting games (included into total) some game days last more than 4.5 hours, but I try to quit before they get that long.

See my other gaming schedules:

# Monthly schedule

The new monthly schedule is for games that shouldn't be played very often. The first game to be added to this is Idle Miner Tycoon, as it was taking up too much time every Tuesday

## Limitations

On Thursday, November 5th 2020, I discovered that all 6 storm8 games no longer let me cheat and have infinite duration on items produced. It glitched out a couple times and let items be preserved for over 2 weeks without paying extra. This doesn't seem to work anymore, and now the sessions are being operated differently.

> Minor update from November 19th 2020: this issue no longer applies to Farm Story (unless the 4 day crop expires before the 8 day point) but I have gotten used to gameplay like this.

2 days are dreaded to me (Friday and Saturday) as my Egg Inc and AdCom/AdCap sessions drag on too long due to procrastination and addiction problems. I have been working for months (as of March 24th 2021) to try and find a fix for these days

## Notes

Gameplay is photographed as part of my journaling project, and for stock imagery. Ads are photographed too.

I originally played on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge from 2016 to November 12th 2020. As of November 13th 2020, I began transitioning gameplay away from the old S7 edge to a new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I got on November 12th 2020. I really like the phone, there is only 1 part of it I consider a downgrade, which is that I went from a screen resolution of 2560x1440 (horizontal, 1440p) 1440x2560 (vertical, 1440p) to 2000x1080 (horizontal, 1080p) 1080x2000 (vertical, 1080p) the only game I still actively play on my old phone is Jewels, because it isn't compatible with Android 10.0, and I want to max out my score on it before abandoning my old S7 edge

Starting on November 19th 2020, I began to play Tiny Death Star again. As the game proves functional and fun, I have decided to turn it into a weekly thing. I will be playing this game every Friday. The first time I played on the weekly schedule was Friday, November 20th 2020.

## Under consideration

* It is under consideration that Lego Tower gameplay should be moved to Wednesday, as Thursday already has 6 games set. It takes me all the way down to 13% battery to successfully play all 7 games under a new style. The con of this is that Wednesday (alonh with Friday) is a lax day, with 3 required games instead of 4. I am unsure if I want to get rid of my only free day.

* It is under consideration if I will resume playing Tiny Tower in 2021 or not. On January 27th 2021, my phone was auto-updated to Android 11. Tiny Tower kept crashing upon trying to play, and I lost my 620+ consecutive day streak. Accidentally a few days later, I found the game worked again, but didn't feel like playing due to my lost progress. I am still trying to gain interest to play again.

> As of March 24th 2021, I have not resumed gameplay. On February 17th 2021, this status post was shortened to save memory. See previous entries for more info.

> I have been starting to consider playing at night again, but at the moment, I am happy to have no major tasks to do after I wrap up GitHub work for the night.

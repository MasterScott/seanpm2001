## Limitations

There are few times where I have the time to play these games at the moment (March 29th 2021)

## Notes

Gameplay is photographed as part of my journaling project, and for stock imagery. Ads are photographed too.

I originally played on a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge from 2016 to November 12th 2020. As of November 13th 2020, I began transitioning gameplay away from the old S7 edge to a new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I got on November 12th 2020. I really like the phone, there is only 1 part of it I consider a downgrade, which is that I went from a screen resolution of 2560x1440 (horizontal, 1440p) 1440x2560 (vertical, 1440p) to 2000x1080 (horizontal, 1080p) 1080x2000 (vertical, 1080p) the only game I still actively play on my old phone is Jewels, because it isn't compatible with Android 10.0, and I want to max out my score on it before abandoning my old S7 edge

Starting on November 19th 2020, I began to play Tiny Death Star again. As the game proves functional and fun, I have decided to turn it into a weekly thing. I will be playing this game every Friday. The first time I played on the weekly schedule was Friday, November 20th 2020.

# V1.0.4 - GitHub Profile secret (September 18th 2020 update)

## V1.0.4

### About

This is an archive of the fifth version of my GitHub profile README secret repository. I learned of this easter egg via another GitHub users profile. This is my own version. I have now repurposed this repository.
I have been procrastinating on publishing a new release for nearly a month. I finally got around to it today. In this release, I:

> * Added many new pictures of my commit count

> * Added many new pictures regarding GitHub

> * Created version 2 of the `README.md` file

> * Created an archive of the first 2 versions of the `README.md` file

> * Added some CSV tests

> * Added several pre-release Gists

> * No other changes in this release

This project might be updated more than expected.

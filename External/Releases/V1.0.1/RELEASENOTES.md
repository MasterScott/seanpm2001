# V1.0.1 - GitHub Profile secret (Late August 22nd 2020 update)

## V1.0.1

### About

This is an archive of the second version of my GitHub profile README secret repository. I learned of this easter egg via another GitHub users profile. This is my own version. I have now repurposed this repository. In this release, I:

> * Added some sandbox files

> * Added some Gist development files

> * No other changes in this release

This project might be updated more than expected.

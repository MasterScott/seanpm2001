# V1.0.3 - GitHub Profile secret (Late August 28th 2020 update)

## V1.0.3

### About

This is an archive of the fourth version of my GitHub profile README secret repository. I learned of this easter egg via another GitHub users profile. This is my own version. I have now repurposed this repository. In this release, I:

> * Added some new pictures of my commit count

> * Added the ProjectWiki and releases directories

> * Added 2 release candidates for version 66 of the SeanPM_OnGitHub Gist

> * No other changes in this release

This project might be updated more than expected.

Commit count: `41`

Commits in last release: `18`

Commit change: `23`

GitHub version: `4 (Saturday, August 29th 2020 at 1:41 pm) - V1.03 - GitHub Profile secret (Late August 28th 2020 update))` - I was supposed to update this last night, I didn't have the time and focus.

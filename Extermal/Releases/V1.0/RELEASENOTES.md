# V1.0 - GitHub Profile secret

## V1.0

### About

This is an archive of the first version of my GitHub profile README secret repository. I learned of this easter egg via another GitHub users profile. This is my own version. In this release, I:

> * Started the project

> * Added a license

> * Added a random .gitignore file

> * Added a README.md file (version 1)

> * No other changes in this release

This project won't be updated very often.

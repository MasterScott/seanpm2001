# Note:

Daily status posts are labeled as issues and are closed at the start of each month. They are located separately. See [here](/DailyStatus/) to view them.

Some issues are still present in this directory. I am currently deciding on archiving the issues here as well, with the exception of metadata being included.

# Privacy policy

I archive my own GitHub discussions and issues. By default, I respect users privacy, and will not have your issue or discussion archived. You have to specifically ask for it to be archived if you want it to be.

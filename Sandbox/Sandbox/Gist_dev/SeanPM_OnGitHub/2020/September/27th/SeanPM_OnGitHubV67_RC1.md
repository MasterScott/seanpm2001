# About me

My name is Sean Patrick Myrick. I am an experienced programmer. I started with Scratch back in early 2015, but I reached the limits of Scratch and I needed to move on. My first language was HTML, but I could only make very basic things for now. In 2018, I began to learn Python, which became my favorite programming language. /

In 2019, I took an AP Java class for a year. I completed every programming class at my High School, but I kept going. During my time with Java class, I began branching off and experimenting with other languages along with Java, such as C, C++, Fortran, Batch, VisualBasicScript, and more. 

I made a huge discovery in January of 2019 when I linked an HTML file to another file. Once I clicked the link and moved to another file, this spurred me into a web development era. I began learning more and more about HTML over time, and I got better and better at it. I then began learning other languages to go with it, such as CSS, JS, PHP, Ruby, XML, AJAX, and jQuery. I am still learning, but at a slower pace at the moment. I have 2 parts of my programming career, the offline part, and the web development part.

# Intro

I joined GitHub on May 25th 2020. It was a long decision on if I should move to here, but I finally decided on joining. At first, I didn't want to have sensitive info to my projects on GitHub, but overtime, I began accepting more, and now I have all my projects nearly uncensored (identifying info like phone numbers are still excluded) I am now managing my website on this platform.

# Limitations with GitHub

There are some limitations with GitHub that are still holding me back. As of June 2nd 2020 at 2:33 pm, here are my current limitations:

> 1. Uploading 100 files at once, no more

> 2. File upload limit of 25 Megabytes

> 3. Max of 1000 items per directory

> 4. 100 Gigabyte repository size limit (pretty reasonable, but still a limit)

> 5. File name truncation at 255 chars

> 6. No others at the moment

# Commit counts on GitHub

This is a list of my daily commit counts on GitHub since my registration on May 25th 2020, along with blank entries from the creation of GitHub to the time I joined.

On July 31st 2020, I split this section off into its own article to save space here, so that I don't reach the GistHub limit.

## September 1st 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

I had a good day with GitHub development today, but not a very good day with my other projects. I have recently discovered the capabilities of CSV databases on GitHub, and I plan on trying to do something with it tomorrow.

Today was a decent day for GitHub development, but a bad day for personal projects. Today was the 2nd day in a row where I was unable to update my journaling, only writing notes for tonight.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * Nothing, as this day hasn't occurred yet

What I learned on Ubuntu Linux today:

> * Nothing, as this day hasn't occurred yet

I had a decent day with GitHub development, it wasn't as bad today. I tested CSV data on GitHub today, and I really love it. I wasn't able to write the syntax by hand, but I got to use spreadsheet software for the first time in years. I also was able to catch up on my journaling today and have time to play games.1

## September 3rd 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 14th 2020, it is just an example.

I had an OK day for development today. I finally finished a project I have been holding off for half a month, and I made progress on some projects. I also kept up to date on my journaling, and played all my games. I haven't been able to keep up with social media posts lately.

I created my first album on Bandcamp today. It is public domain audio from the first audio playlist I composed. I was unable to upload the second track, as Bandcamp refused to let me upload it due to it being less than 22 kbps. You can view it [here](https://seanwallawalla.bandcamp.com/releases)

I had an OK day with development. I was rushed at the end and had to hold off some work, along with my journaling, as I was running too low on time.

I began to catch up on social media posts today, I have been very behind. I didn't do very much on GitHub today, but I am working on dwindling down the number of projects I am behind in.

I finished work on getting the SNU CloudDrive project up to date. It was a fun start to the project. I have published the first 2 versions, and got to write HTML today.

I had a very good day with development today. I made plans for what I wanted to do today, and I got everything I wanted to get done, done. I worked on various projects, and got caught up on my journaling (I held it off yesterday) and I caught up on the social media posts. I also had a very active day on GitHub.

Today was a good day for development.

I had a relaxed day with development today. I didn't do as much, as I didn't plan as much. I worked on some finishing touches before I go on a vacation to Cannon Beach tomorrow. I decided to post 1 final Gist update before the trip to the main Gist. I am saving other Gist work for tomorrow, as I am going to be in a moving vehicle for 7 hours.

In short, I didn't do as much today, but I got what needed to be done finished. I also started a mega project today, where I upload the non-sensitive parts of my journaling file structure to GitHub. Once I get the images all uploaded, I will be able to save a significant amount of space on my laptop. It is too bad I started this project directly before a vacation where I won't focus on GitHub as much.

For the next few days, I will be in Cannon Beach. I am still going to commit to GitHub, but likely not as much, as I am going to be on the beach. I have some plans to social distance on the beach, including digging a trench around our camping spot. I won't be as active tomorrow, as I am going to be riding in a truck for nearly 7 hours.

I did the final preparations today, and I am ready for my vacation.

I didn't do very much today, I was on vacation at Cannon Beach. It was an unusual vacation, and didn't go very well. Today, I did the bare minimum, just image uploads, no programming. I am now using GitHub as a Git-based image hosting service as well. I hope to get back into programming soon.

Tonight, after redoing some uploads due to an error, I finalized and shut down. As I was going to sleep, the power flickered twice, causing the fan (whitenoise and coldness) to go out. The power outage would last over 12 hours. Electrical lines and trees caught on fire and the power grid was shut down.

I didn't do very much today. I didn't do all the things I wanted to do in the truck ride, I saved Gist work for another time, and just did journaling. I wasn't very productive today.

What I learned on GitHub today:

> * There was a change to the upload animation, where a retry button is now there at all times. It made me feel like there is an error each time I upload (up to September 14th 2020, when I got used to it)

> * No other GitHub-based discoveries on September 7th 2020

I continued my vacation today. We left the apartment after a while. 1 other family member had to do online learning via a mobile hotspot, due to the continued power outage. We later went to the beach for a few hours, and then drove out to Wendys. We then got into our new hotel, which had its power restored recently.

I didn't do any programming work today. There was Internet, and it was also faster than the previous hotel. I continued to do Git-based image hosting and uploads. Wihile waiting for the new hotel room, I stayed in the truck and tried to connect to the Wi-Fi, but couldn't without a registered room number, so I did offline Gist work while I waited.

Today is the 2 month anniversary of my new Linux laptop. I did very little work today. I mostly took today off. I played games through most of the morning, and went to the pool and the beach (I also went to the pool last night) throughout my whole childhood, I have never been able to touch at the 5 feet point comfortably with the top of my neck not being underwater. I am now able to finally do so after 18 years (I have been coming to Cannon Beach every 2 years since 2002)

I did very little work tonight, only doing 2 uploads. I lowered the bar for my work by doing this, but it didn't last. I had to get something done today, and it was nearly bedtime, so I just did some uploads. I went through some personal issues today as well. Today was my worst day for GitHub development to date.

Today is the 2 month anniversary of no longer using Windows 10 as a host operating system. I didn't do very much work today, I had a long trip home from Cannon Beach, where I did journaling work. I didn't do very much today, and I had a very long trip home. I had a bad day with development.

Today was an OK day for development. Today, I did some research on ActionScript/Adobe Flash, and started a new project based off a video of gameplay of Snail Bob 2 I watched last night, which was a level maker for the game.

Today, I was supposed to start in person school with a very small class of a maximum of 5 people (including teachers and me) unfortunately, my teacher injured his knee, so I couldn't meet him today.

I did more image uploads today, and got distracted frequently. I have been tasked with stress testing our Internet to confirm an issue with a 30 year old line under the house.

What I learned today:

> I learned more about ChromeOS from my dad: it isn’t just a web browser, it also has an Android back-end and can install Android programs.
So it is pretty much just Android. Maybe Virtualizing it is still possible and maybe even reasonable?
My dad was also noting how similar ChromeOS is to Windows, making comparisons for the start button, close buttons, etc.
most systems have this, but I think he is also right on this one, as it would be reasonable for Google to replicate an operating system known by so many for a laptop/PC.
Some of my previous knowledge related to this is that ChromeOS was originally Gentoo based (not confirmed at the moment by me) and as of recently is now Debian based (also not confirmed at the moment by me, as in I don’t have any sources) 
If true, both operating systems have the same structure.
> I also recently learned that Manjaro Linux is not Arch, (it is Arch based, I still don’t know what differentiates the “based” and the “not” I don’t know enough about how a Linux distribution is classified)
and:
> I also recently learned that Linux Mint is Debian based, I originally thought it was its own distribution. These discoveries were from the Manjaro Wiki. 
> I learned more about ActionScript 2.0 and 3.0
> No other things were learned today

Today was a third image upload day. I didn't do any programming again, but want to get back into it. I had a hard day today. I got to go to my class, I didn't get to communiucate with the teacher as much as I thought I would. I also had to use a Chromebook, as I was told not to bring my laptop, but when I got there, I was allowed to use my laptop. So I will bring it tomorrow. I had some bad nostalgia for some parts of ChromeOS, but mostly the high school itself.

I had a day where I got back into programming today. I recently learned a little bit about Verilog and SystemVerilog programming. I went to school for a 2nd day today, bringing my laptop this time. It went OK, but I left early, as I already finished the first curriculum within the first 2 hours and 15 minutes (I go for 2 hours a day)

I missed some medication today, and caused a significant error, leading to tons of pain. It took me a few days (up to September 17th 2020) to recover.

I started a new project on GitHub today related to separating SNU modules into SubModules, starting with SNU_ProgrammingTools. I thought it would make a wide array of programming languages searchable on my profile, but I didn't account for the giant HTML files (34+ kilobytes) on each one. I can still make it work. I feel like this will make the module easier to handle.

I stayed home from school today, as I was feeling incredibly sick to the stomach. I neglected some important needs and almost died. I won't go into the details here. I had to work from home to recover.

I did some work today, it wasn't true programming, it was just Wiki work, and image uploads. I was able to make a full recovery by the next day.

Today was a difficult day for me. I went to school again today, and got some work done at school, as I finished early (I started before even going to school) I did more Wiki work and brief image uploads today. I also finalized a Gist project for the night. I had to face a great personal issue tonight. It affected everyone in the family.

We have had a rescue dog named Mila since 2015/2016. I became attached to her within hours, and we were not able to return her to the humane society. She had a series of abusive owners before us, and by the time she got to us, she had most of her teeth missing, she was severey paranoid, and would later go on to develop Dementia and schizophrenia.

She wasn't the most fun dog at times, especially as she aged, but I still cared for her. As her dementia got worse, the rest of the family tolerated her less and less. That brings us to today.

Today (and last night) Mila has been refusing to eat or drink, and she is now expected to die within 48 hours. I have had several breakdowns over this tonight, and I damaged my heart from how hard I was crying for hours. I have never had such strong emotional feelings, they only seem to grow stronger by the year.

I am trying not to go into defail, as I will burst into tears if I do it that much. It is a natural part of life, but it is always hard when you care about someone and they are dying, and after she goes, I will never see her again. I am about to cry writing this.

Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 22nd 2020, it is just an example.

I had a really hard day today. I woke up early, worrying about Mila (getting less than 6 hours of sleep) and I went to check on her. A couple hours later, she started yelping in pain repeatedly, and we pet her to calm her down.
We had to call to get her euthanized, and the appointment was at 10:00 am. It was sad up to that point, only getting more sad and depressing the closer the time got. I was able to go with, but not go inside. She died at 10:14 am, and it was very hard.
We brought her home. I had to try and "bring myself up" as everyone in the house was really upset about it. I got some work done today, a lot more than as of lately.

I worked on various projects: the usual daily projects, some new image projects, and I resumed work on WacOS after a nearly 5 month hiatus. I got alot done with it, and I had a decent day.
Later on in the evening, we had a funeral for Mila. I got to pet her one last time, even though she couldn't feel it. I have been crying on and off today, I never recover from things like this. I will always remember her. I still remember and mourn the loss of pets from over a decade ago. I am just glad my family got to give Mila a good ending to her life, and that we put her out of her misery when it was too sufferable to live with.
It was a horrible day for me. It is going to take me a few days to recover enough to be less depressed, but I will always be sad about this.

I did not go to school today. I was in far too much distress. A weird coincidence was that my teacher didn't want me to show up today, as he was having issues as well.

I had a better day with development today, mostly working on image repositories. I wrapped up a lot of them. I also worked on it during class, as the assignment was easy, and I worked on it when I came up with new ideas for it.

I have found my favorite sound on my computer now, I normally am not able to pick favorites on audio, but I have noted that my favorite GNOME 3 sound is `sonar.ogg` this one is without a doubt my favorite GNOME 3 sound effect.

i had a chaotic end to my development today. Work throughout the day up to near 10:00 pm was pretty normal. I worked on various image repositories again. I finally felt ready to upload media of Mila. I am still sad about losing her, but I feel like it is now appropriate to start posting pictures of her.

Near quitting time, I discovered that I could have created a GitHub organization this entire time. I was originally deceived by the layout, making me think I had to pay money or already own a company to make one. That was not how it went, and it ended up overloading my mind. It felt like I had to start from zero, as I only could figure out how to clone my repositories to the organizations, which wiped out a lot of data and made over 2000 duplicate commits. I stopped doing this and gave up for the night, beginning to research it more.

I had to quit with a mind full of questions, and I felt like I ruined all my days work.

I had a better day with development today. I began to correct the organization issue. For now, individually forking all my projects is the answer, I am going to probably feel worse than yesterday when I find out a better way of doing things, as then I will know I really ruined a lot of work.

I have been learning the basics of pull requests today, specifically merge pull requests. I have also been playing around a lot with Vim today. I mostly worked on image uploading today, but I also worked on some SNU modules and other projects. Today was an OK day for development.

## September 24th 2020 DS

DS, in this sense, stands for: Daily Status. Not to be confused with the Nintendo DS/2DS/3DS/2DS XL/other DS (Dual Screen) brands. I have to do this so each web anchor has its own ID and that there aren't 2 anchors with the same value. Web anchors are like this: https://www.example.com#Section1 it goes to a specific part of the page. This section on example.com currently doesn't exist as of July 22nd 2020, it is just an example.

I am finally getting the organization thing down. Today was a weird day for development, I didn't do any programming work today. I spent some time doing Gist work, as that is what the majority of the rest of my end of month goals involve.

I am starting to get familar with pull requests as well. I have been working a lot on forking my own projects to put into organizations, as that is the best way of doing it. I have noted that I misused the GitHub "projects" feature. I should have been using organizations.

I would have worked with GitHub organizations sooner if I wasn't thrown off by the plans screen. The way it was described and set up, it really made me feel like I had to register an actual company first and also pay money and do other things. I should have done this a lot sooner.

I worked from school again today, I have gotten a new schedule recently, and I had to go to bed early again. It is for the best, as I need to get my sleep.

I have also updated the priority on my journaling work today, it is now something I will update very frequently and not hold off for more than 14 hours at a time.

I had a short day with development today. I didn't do too much, and most work was image uploads. I have recently set some end of month Gist goals, but I am having difficulty reaching them.

Today wasn't a very good day for development on GitHub. I also found that I am not easily able to make a 2nd pull request in a single repository. I am trying to figure this out. One method I tried was branching, but it hasn't worked for me.

Today was an extremely good day for development. I worked on various projects, the most developed one was an idea I have been developing for a month, which is a startup sound library and manager. I put hundreds of commits into it today.

Today was a special anniversary day for my journaling as well today, today was the 4 year (1491 day) anniversary of my daily journaling (Since September 26th 2016) I have started to prioritize creating branches on GitHub, but I have stopped prioritizing it, as I feel like I am going to hit the 100 gigabyte repository limit much faster if I do so.

I had a good day with development  today. I started a new goal last night, which was to make my software more advanced and not focus on simplification, and also to put my projects out in multiple languages. As I only know English, I had to use machine translation. I will rely on contributers to fix mistakes, and I will have a review process for this.

I set a lot of goals today, and I managed to finish most of them. I have to go to back to school tomorrow, so I am going to bed early again tonight.

Stuff I learned last night:

> * Starting to learn about POSCAP (Conductive Polymer Tantalum Solid Capacitors (POSCAP)

> * The major aspect in hardware technology is to keep the power going _u///Every electron missed can cause data corruption///u_ (laptop might have some power issue, possibly explaining some system files getting corrupted occasionally, such as pulseaudio)

> * The source code for Windows XP was leaked on September 25th 2020

> * I need to tighten down on the development of software that is too easy on the "monkey brain" such as instant access apps like YouTube and Facebook, which only tell you what you want to hear.

> * Video cameras on Android and iOS phones are typically capped at 29:59 per video file, as cameras recording more than 30 minutes of video at a time are considered video cameras and have a higher tax. This is an outdated law that should be fixed

## Khan Academy

I am a regular user of Khan Academy, with 1162 consecutive days and counting. I normally watch 1 video a day and read the article succeeding it, but sometimes I watch multiple videos. I was originally introduced to Khan Academy in Middle School, and I got back into it as an extra task once I completed my Microsoft Office classes.

## My experience with Scratch

I started to learn programming in early 2015 (I currently don't remember whether it was January or February 2015) I started with the very basics, learning Scratch 2.0. I was a little bad at first, but once I got a few concepts, I picked up from there and became obsessed with it, then making over 1200 projects over the course of nearly 4 years. Some of these projects have great detail to them. I stopped using Scratch and moved on eventually, as there were limits, such as what I could do with it, the 360p resolution limit, and the 50 megabyte project limit. I am glad I quit when I did, as shortly after I quit, Scratch 3.0 was released, and it looks like a giant hot mess to me.

## YouTube and early times on social media

I got a FaceBook account in early 2015, but abandoned it pretty quickly. I then started a YouTube channel on May 14th 2015 under the name Sean Walla Walla. I uploaded random videos at the time, and over time, I began to get consistency. I uploaded mediocre videos at first, but at the peak of my time on YouTube, I uploaded mediocre videos as well. The mass uploading started in 2016, with the daily stat series, where I archived game process on 10 different games with a less than 1 minute 15 second video for each game daily. I also made a lot of my videos in different speed formats, some of these were successful. My YouTube career is something I do not look fondly back upon. It tore up my life in 2017 and 2018, the obsession caused me to set ridiculous wake up times and bedtimes, such as waking up from 6:00 am down to 2:50 am, and going to bed from 9:00 pm to 6:30 pm. I was trying to spread myself as well, and I left comments on many videos. I didn't entirely get edginess at the time, and looking back, I have a bunch of crappy comments. I think about them constantly every day. I spread to various platforms, including Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo, and some others, but it ultimately ended in June of 2018 when I ran into an error that made over 400 images corrupted (as my video recorder began having severe problems) and I finally just gave up on it. Now I could focus on my programming career even more, and leave this behind me. However, I still plan on archiving my accounts, I just haven't found the time or resources, as there is an estimated 1+ terabytes of data, and right now, my laptop doesn't even get more than 4 MBPS connection speed, so that would never work, especially with Spectrum failing every single day (our Wi-Fi has been going out on a daily basis 1 to 4 times a day for nearly a week as of June 21st 2020)

## Virtualization

In the summer of 2018, I got into virtual machines. I originally started by trying to get 1 virtual machine to run, but I was really bad at it at the time. Within a day, I got Windows XP mode running, but it was really crummy due to how basic it was. So I had some help from [channa-my](https://gist.github.com/channa-my) who gave me one of his copies of Windows XP, along with a product key. Once I got this running, my interest in virtualization blew up, and I began to try and emulate as many operating systems as I could, including Linux, MacOS, Android, almost every version of Windows, and many attempts at iOS. I made over 200 virtual machines, then one day, they were all destroyed due to Windows 10 [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot) so I lost over 240 Gigabytes of data. I have been trying to get back into Virtualization in 2020, as of June 20th 2020, I have 4 virtual machines, a Kubuntu 18.0.4.2 VM, a Fedora 31 workstation VM, a virtual machine that mimics a [Samsung Galaxy S2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_II) (the only problem is that I was only able to find an Android 2.2 ISO and not a 2.3 ISO, plus it is recognized as an ASUS device, and might not have the same CPU specs as an S2) and another attempt at a Windows XP virtual machine, where it all started.

## Farming

I live on a ranch, and have many animals. We have over a dozen chickens, 2 cats, 4 dogs, 3 fish, 3 horses, and some goats. On May 25th 2020, one of our goats gave birth to 2 baby goats. It happened at 1:30 in the morning, and by the time someone went out there to check on them, they were already cleaned off. They have been really fun.

## Political

## Tech support

I offer free tech support at random for people who need it. Although I no longer use Windows 10 as a primary OS (As of July 10th 2020) I can still offer Windows technical support due to 14 years of experience. I also offer the tech support for Windows 10 where if desired, I will take all the time needed to fix a Windows 10 setup without doing a reset, as I avoided this as well, and I found it inconvenient. I also give out all the steps so that you can fix it on your own, even if it is just a restart. Please note, the first 3 times an issue is fixable with a restart, I won't charge anything, but if the same issue is encountered a fourth time within a 366 day period, I start charging $1.00 per fix (if I can't charge, then I won't help after this point)

My other tech support info was moved to a separate Gist on August 1st 2020. You can view more info [here](https://gist.github.com/seanpm2001/e45eea830c60e340c6cb5344db215bf8#Tech-support).

## Stock photography

I take screenshots constantly while playing most games. I have repurposed this from only being progress tracking to stock photography.

The stock images I produce contain no watermarks, I won't even require credit to be given on their usage. Note that plagiarism is still not allowed, you don't have to credit me, but you can't claim the images as your own.

I have hundeds of thousands of stock photos at the moment, totaling well over 50 gigabytes. I have stock photos for:

## Gist Info

Gist version: `67 (Sunday, September 27th 2020 at 9:50 pm)` - RC1 - September 27th 2020 at 9:50 pm

File type: `markdown (*.md)`

Character count (UNIX (LF) / Macintosh (CR)): `258,187 characters/bytes (258.18 Kilobytes)`

Character count (WIndows (CR) (LF)): `264,330 characters/bytes (264.33 Kilobytes)`

Word count: `0,035,186`

Note (July 27th 2020) since I have been editing this Gist offline due to its massive size, I decided that I should do my classic character count method. I also added a word count counter

Note (July 31st 2020) I have moved 2 articles out of the main Gist and into separate Gists, now known as chapters. I had to do this after concerns about the file size and length of the main Gist. 2 major problems being the Gist was getting close to the size where it wouldn't be previewable anymore, or may have reached a limit on GistHub. This change has reduced the size by over 230 kilobytes, and I intend to nove more articles, especially all articles with subsections.

Line count (including blank lines and compiler line): `005,271`

Gist debug
The issue is likely the ` ` set, as it worked fine before this set (or single) however I am not 100% sure, this is the most likely answer I can think of. If this doesn't work, further debugging is required. We MUST fix this today

I learned more about ChromeOS from Chris: it isn’t just a web browser, it also has an Android back-end and can install Android programs.
So it is pretty much just Android. Maybe Virtualizing it is still possible and maybe even reasonable?
Chris was also noting how similar ChromeOS is to Windows, making comparisons for the start button, close buttons, etc.
most systems have this, but I think he is also right on this one, as it would be reasonable for Google to replicate an operating system known by so many for a laptop/PC.
Some of my previous knowledge related to this is that ChromeOS was originally Gentoo based (not confirmed at the moment by me) and as of recently is now Debian based (also not confirmed at the moment by me, as in I don’t have any sources) 
If true, both operating systems have the same structure. I also recently learned that Manjaro Linux is not Arch, (it is Arch based, I still don’t know what differentiates the “based” and the “not” I don’t know enough about how a Linux distribution is classified)
and I also recently learned that Linux Mint is Debian based, I originally thought it was its own distribution. These discoveries were from the Manjaro Wiki.

I am finally getting the organization thing down. Today was a weird day for development, I didn't do any programming work today. I spent some time doing Gist work, as that is what the majority of the rest of my end of month goals involve.
I am starting to get familar with pull requests as well. I have been working a lot on forking my own projects to put into organizations, as that is the best way of doing it. I have noted that I misused the GitHub "projects" feature. I should have been using organizations.
I would have worked with GitHub organizations sooner if I wasn't thrown off by the plans screen. The way it was described and set up, it really made me feel like I had to register an actual company first and also pay money and do other things. I should have done this a lot sooner.
I worked from school again today, I have gotten a new schedule recently, and I had to go to bed early again. It is for the best, as I need to get my sleep.
I have also updated the priority on my journaling work today, it is now something I will update very frequently and not hold off for more than 14 hours at a time.

Learned today:
Changing the base on a pull request

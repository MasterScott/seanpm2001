### Late Status update: December 23rd 2020

I had a good day with development today. I began writing Project Wikis again today. I tried to reach 154 commits today, but I got tired and quit early. I worked on 28 different repositories today.

I have started to re-invest heavily in the Linux defender project recently, today was the 2nd day of doing so. I also wrote lots of good documentation today.

Today was an OK day for development.

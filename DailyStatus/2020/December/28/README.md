### Status update: December 28th 2020

I didn't do very much again today. I mostly worked on image uploads. I have been working on fixing my schedule, dealing with incidents, and recovering my health. I am hoping to be able to do a lot more tomorrow.

Today, I did some work on the optometry project. I put some work into it, but after research, there is a lot more to it than I thought, and I will need to work more on it tomorrow.

I ran into some technical issues today, especially with Bluetooth. Unfortunately, I had to switch headphones for now.

Today was not a very good day for development.

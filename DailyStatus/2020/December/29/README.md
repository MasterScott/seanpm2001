### Status update: December 29th 2020

I didn't do very much again today. I mostly worked on image uploads. I have been working on fixing my schedule, dealing with incidents, and recovering my health. I am hoping to be able to do a lot more tomorrow.

Today, I did a lot of work on the optometry project. I realized that a method I was using for programming was far too inefficient, so I paused development on this part until I can find a better method. I expanded on the concept today, adding support for many languages and alphabets, along with the first source code for the project.

My bluetooth technical issue did not occur today. This was not a concern today.

I managed to reach activity level 3 (green, 154+ commits) today, which is unexpected. I plan to reach green 3 again on new years eve.

Today was a good day for development.

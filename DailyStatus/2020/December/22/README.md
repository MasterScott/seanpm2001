### Status: December 22nd 2020

I finished the days goals with great time today, but I didn't have much else to do. I have decided to start doing the tasks on my old to do lists for when I have time, so that I can reach 150+ commits per day again. I have been feeling pretty unproductive lately. 

Today, I didn't continue work on the video directory project, I am taking a break from it today, as I still have to figure out how I am going to factor in the older directories.

As a side task today, I cleaned out the downloads folder on my laptop and did mass organization for it. It is now cleaner and easier to manage.

My phone crashed for the first time today at 2:36:38 the cause of the crash is unknown. Luckily, it kicked me off the game before I could waste any more time.

Today was an OK day for development.

### Status update: December 24th 2020

I had a good day with development again today. I began writing Project Wikis again today. I managed to achieve my goal and reach green 2 (154 commits in one day) activity on GitHub, something I haven't been able to achieve for nearly 3 weeks. It might be my last hoo-rah of the year, I am thinking of trying 1 last time though.

I have started to re-invest heavily in the Linux defender project recently, today was the 3rd day of doing so. I also wrote lots of good documentation today, and did lots of Wiki work, along with the usual Thursday work.

Today was an OK day for development.

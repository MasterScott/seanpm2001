### Status update: December 31st 2020

I didn't do too much again today. Time really seems to be moving quickly. I worked on most of what I wanted to accomplish today, except for finalizing the Wiki on 15 projects. 

I discovered a limitation on GNOME today, which is I can't show the year on the titlebar. I wanted KDE anyway, but I still can't switch my DE. I worked a lot on documentation and image uploads today. Today wasn't too excited, but it went by really fast. I am excited to see my new 2021 panel on GitHub tomorrow, I have been waiting for nearly 2 months now. I am saving the excitement for tomorrow. I start with a new clean slate of monthly progress tomorrow.

I managed to reach activity level 3 (green, 154+ commits) today, which was planned for. I have made a backwards L to give the L to 2020 (but not a full L, as many good things did happen this year for me)

Today was a good day for development.

Happy New Years! Goodbye 2020, hello 2021. I won't be up to work on GitHub at 12:00 am, I plan on sending a message on Discord, as it is the best I can do for the moment.

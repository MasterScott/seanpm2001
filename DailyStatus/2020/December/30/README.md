### Status update: December 30th 2020

I didn't do very much again today. I mostly worked on image uploads. I have been working on fixing my schedule, dealing with incidents, and recovering my health. I am hoping to be able to do a lot more tomorrow.

Today, I did a lot of work on the optometry project, finalizing the structure of the language system, but nothing else. Other than that, I did lots of Wiki work in various projects. I had a great deal of free time today due to my Wednesday schedule, and my game not going well, so I had lots of spare time to work and relax today, but stiil go to bed early. I plan on staying up for new years, but I likely won't be committing past 11:45 pm. I will send a Discord message to bring in the new year (if I can remember)

My bluetooth technical issue did not occur again today. This was not a concern today. However, my laptops battery issues are getting worse. When I got the laptop, the capacity was 94.0 but could charge to 100%. Recently, it has dropped to 89.9 capacity, ever since it started reading incorrectly. I don't know what it means, as capacity is used so vaguely. Today, my battery immediately dropped from 100% to 94% upon unplugging. I am considering more and more on having a backup laptop, so I can do repairs on my main.

I managed to reach activity level 3 (green, 154+ commits) today, which was less unexpected. I plan to reach green 3 again on new years eve, making a backwards L to give the L to 2020 (but not a full L, as many good things did happen this year for me)

Today was a good day for development.

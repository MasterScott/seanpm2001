### Status update: December 25th 2020

I didn't do as much today. I spent time with my family for the Christmas holiday. I got 10 presents, the thought really counts. I got a new TV, which I am also now using as a monitor.

I had some issues today, and had to go and distract for a bit. I also finally came up with some project language puns. I am considering making project language files for all image projects soon.

I did a decent amount of work today, but not a lot. I skipped wiki work today, and stayed up really late.

I am working on learning Inkscape to digitally manipulate images, as I feel with the major RAM hogs I already have (Firefox with over 100 tabs, 3 LibreOffice documents, and a garbage filled nautilus) GIMP probably won't be an option. I have some ideas. Today I took my first steps and learned how to import an image.

Today was an OK day for development.

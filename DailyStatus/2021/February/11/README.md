### Status update: February 11th 2021

I had a pretty hard night last night. Unfortunately, this made my day a lot harder. I am not sure if I got any sleep last night, but I might have gotten about 3 hours. I feel like I was asleep from around 2:00 am to 5:00 am, but at the same time, I felt like I was awake at this time. It was a very difficult night.

Last night, I did something on GitHub on my phone after quitting for the day. Logging in on my phone through a web browser feels really good. Tonight, I decided to follow over 1000 users from the CPython (Python) repository in hopes of getting more followers and getting at least 1 person to help actively contribute with me, as I have been trying everything I can to get help lately. I had to be careful with this. After observing about 3 bots that did similar things to me (they might have not been bots) I noted that you can only follow up to around 230 people at a time (in a 5-10 minute period) without GitHub noticing, so I followed a maximum of 120 people at a time, then took a break. I stopped for the night at past 1000. I didn't want to cause a deeply negative impact, and I also didn't want to just seem like a bot who follows people, but I might have done too much. I did this, also because I learned a social media psychology trick, where when the number of people you are following greatly exceeds the amount of people who are following you, people tend to want to follow. Also, since I reached thousands of people, some of them followed back. I went from 21 follower to 40 by 3:40 pm the next day. It was a little bit disappointing, because there still isn't anyone interacting with me, and even worse, a documentation thing I have been doing has been completely ruined by what I did last night, as now over 90% of the people I am following aren't being linked to as being followed. It is an easy trick, but with the current results, I don't recommend doing it yourself, as it ruins the ratio of followers to following, and can make you really seem like a bot.

This weekend, I plan on experimenting with a custom network, as I have been getting more into networking lately. I plan on creating a network running pi-hole to experiment with it. Edit; nevermind, I don't have a raspberry pi, and a ton of research is needed so I can confine all the DNS changes to a single Wi-Fi network, as I could really screw everyone in the house by blocking access to 99.9% of the sites they visit.

I didn't contribute to the ruffle-rs project today, I felt like I was trying too hard, and that I needed to better learn code review before doing something like this again.

I have been in a lot of stomach sickness today yet again, along with severe nausea, but no anxiety attacks today. I am hoping it will eventually get fixed, I am still looking for solutions, but I have been in agony for 19 days now.

I had to work late tonight, but I will be going to bed as early as I can tonight. I can still do so much with so little sleep.

Today was a decent day for development.

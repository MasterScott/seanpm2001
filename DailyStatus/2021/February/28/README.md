### Status update: February 28th 2021

Today was a slow day for me. I slept in really late (10:55 am) and struggled a bit in the morning. I have been feeling pretty out of it today.

With GitHub work today, I resumed work on the code-distancing project after a long hiatus (October 9th 2020) I upgraded the project a lot today, and added a new joke theme. However, it was very time consuming, and it caused me to delay journaling work.

My S key is still having problems, but the other keys are doing fine now. The S key is having ~5 minute moments where it has no error, then I have to deal with it randomly capitalizing, doubling the amount of s's, or simply not registering. It is really frustrating.

Today is the last day of February 2021. I managed to get a ratio of 100+ commits/day for the month, I have been doing badly commit-count wise for most of the month. I can't believe it is already going to be March 2021 tomorrow.

A small thing I noticed: the influx of new followers from my following spree a couple weeks ago has died down. It started with over 20 followers per day, but it has gotten slower and slower. I didn't get any new followers today (as of 7:44 pm) and yesterday I got 2.

I also installed an anti-virus today, as I need one (Linux can get viruses just like any other operating system) I am thinking that there might be some malware on my laptop, as my screen has also been flashing today when transitioning between GitHub tabs. If there isn't, I should still take it safe.

Tonight, I also discovered the /public/ directory, which completely changes some things for me. I got a new fresh start as a file system. I would make it a public network, but I am hesitant at the moment, as I already have enough technical problems at the moment (S key not working correctly) and I don't want to add more until I fix the current issue.

Today was a decent day for development.

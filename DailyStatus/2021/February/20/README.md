### Status update: February 20th 2021

I spent over 6 hours today playing 2 games and relaxing. It was a bit bad for my productivity, but I needed the break. Due to how the schedule is with my family on Saturdays, I will have an extra 1 hour and 30 minutes to work. If GitHub didn't have the recent change of fast file processing, I would have been completely screwed today.

Last night, I entered the first trial decision of the early public release of a sensitive journaling module. The decision is required to take at least 2 months (by April 20th 2021) and will last a maximum of 20 months (until October 20th 2023) 

I stayed up a bit later tonight, and got everything I needed to get done. I still had a decent day. Today, I also found a way to properly format (which repository to add them to and where) and upload my GitHub notes to GitHub. They are an additional layer of documentation. I uploaded all data up to yesterday (todays data will be uploaded tomorrow, or at a later date)

I didn't really do much today. I took a day to relax and go easy on myself, as I have really put myself through an insane amount of work, and I need to register to myself that it is OK to take a break every once in a while (although not a full break, I have still been going for over 1400 consecutive days with no days off, even when I had the flu)

Today was another below decent day for development.

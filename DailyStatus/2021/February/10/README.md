### Status update: February 10th 2021

I had a good day with development today, but I didn't do very much to my projects. I have been actively doing code review on ruffle-rs/ruffle again today, I have been giving words of encouragement, reviewing pull requests and giving my thoughts. I feel good doing this. I have also been learning Rust better in the process and learning how to better respond to people. I learned the usage of parentheses in Rust today, as it is a bit strange compared to Python. I have also learned that “type safety” is not equivalent to “syntax error based on typing semantics that causes a program to crash” so I have adjusted my usage of this word

Today is my 216th day of using a Linux desktop, and I still have the PTSD from Windows. I am still in constant fear of the blue screens and the unfixable (unfixable as in I don't want to bother to fix them, as there were always at least 10 new errors every day, so by the time I could fix half the errors (5) from one day, I would have an additional 40 errors to fix) error messages. So far on Linux, I haven't had any bad error messages (dialog popups don't count, and common fixable errors don't count) and no kernel panics. It feels so great not having to use Windows 10 anymore.

I have been doing very poorly this month. It is already the 10th of February, and I haven't reached 1000 commit yet.

I have also been gaining a lot of new followers recently, I have gained 3 followers in 2 days.

I am going to try and go to bed early tonight, so I can wake up early and get more done tomorrow.

Today was a decent day for development.

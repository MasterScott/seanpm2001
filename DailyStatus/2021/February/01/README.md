### Status update: February 1st 2021

I had difficulty with procrastination, overheating, and stress tonight. I got caught up on my journaling, but by the time I got to finishing GitHub work, I was completely distracted, and had to quit to get ready for bed. This is the first time I have skipped the image naming process.

I didn't do very much today.

Today was not a good day for development.

### Status update: February 24th 2021

My statement on not reaching 153+ commits again anytime soon has been completely obsoleted today. I had an extremely productive day with development across many projects. I did the usual image work, significantly improved my degoogle campaign by creating 34 new article repositories and starting them, doing more big contributions to the Nostalgia Project, upgrading my life archive project to span across the Myrick bloodline (an option I have been preparing for for nearly a week) and creating a root life archive repository.

I started with naming and uploading screenshots early. I got a lot done, and was in a good mood, although a little stressed and depressed at times.

When creating the new article projects, I went slowly, and received no corrupt repositories. However, GitHub was jumping around from 5883, 5884, to 5897 commits on my profile page (when it should have flipped to 5900) and after several attempts to correct it and a 20+ minute wait, I had to get the pictures through my alt GitHub account, so that I could continue working.

I have been really wired and outgoing today. I got a lot done, although I am going to bed a bit earlier tonight. I didn't want to stop working, but I am getting tired and need to go to bed for tomorrow. I feel tomorrow could come close to today productivity-wise.

Today was an extremely day for development.

### Status update: February 9th 2021

I had a much better day today, but I still didn't get as much done, as I dragged my gaming session on too long again. For a few weeks, I have strongly been considering how I will limit my gaming schedule, I might end up dropping this game (Idle Miner Tycoon) as it is wasting too much of my time.

My breathing has greatly improved today, and I have been in a better mood overall. The appointment with my therapist went well, and I got a little more done today, but still not as much as I wanted to get done. I got the usual work done, along with more reviewing of the [Ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle) project, as I have been trying all I can to help with it. I forgot to mention that I did a hard drive backup yesterday. I wasn't able to clear as much space this time.

I got the image uploads I held off yesterday done, and finished my journaling project for the day. I also updated an important health resource for myself [my food index](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SPM_FoodIndex) as I wanted to mark the differences, benefits, and purpose of the rewrite.

Today was a much better day for development.

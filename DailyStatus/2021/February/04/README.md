### Status update: February 4th 2021

I got a little more done today, but I had to hold off more work. I got woken up early today and had less than 8 hours of sleep. I am going to go to bed early to make up for it and attempt to fix my schedule.

GitHub has recently (yesterday) changed the interface again, making the contribution graph have beveled squares (squares with rounded corners) instead of uncurved squares. I consider this a positive change and a step forward in GitHub's design.

I also witnessed Microsoft applying this update to GitHub, as I was refreshing at the time that a test was going on. My 2021 tab was fine, but there was an extra section in my 2020 section that had a broken commit graph above the other commit graph, with 5 thick lines of the 5 contribution colors. The font and text size was also really screwed up (only in the 2020 section) overlapping the commit tiles, but it was fixed within 2 hours.

Today, I further worked on my article against Google Chrome. I began to translate the article into different languages today. Ironically, I have to use Google Translate for this, as unfortunately, there are no other good translating services for what I need. I have tried Bing Translate, but it isn't as good, and I have tried DeepL, but it only had 4 languages when I originally tried it (it has more now, but still less than 12, compared to Google Translates 106 languages, as of 2018) machine translation is currently inaccurate, as it is far from perfect. I trust that it is still somewhat readable, but I am going to need contributors to help me find and fix translation errors in all translations from English. Unfortunately, I don't have my own translator yet, so if you want to help, you are going to have to provide sources on the used words, and sources on their usage and guide me through it, as I know very few words in languages other than English and can't form a full sentence in anything but English.

I chose Polish as one of the languages, even though it isn't the most common. One reason was because the top repository in the [#degoogle-your-life](https://github.com/topics/degoogle-your-life) topic is in Polish, and I wanted to try and connect with the 19 stargazers of this project. The main reason though was to add support for as many languages as possible, so that anyone can get informed on this subject.

I also did the usual work. I was going to expand on it and make monthly renovations, but I ran out of time and focus.

I didn't do very much today.

Today was a better day for development.

### Status update: February 8th 2021

I had a very difficult day today. My health has deteriorated badly, and now I don't have enough health to hold my anxiety back, so I had anxiety attacks for nearly 11 hours straight today. It has been incredibly hard for me to breath correctly (despite my oxygen level being 96%) I am still breathing enough, but I have been hurting my lungs. This has greatly impacted my work today, as I was in too much pain for most of the day to do anything, which is highly unlike me.

I was finally able to recover past 8:30 pm. I found that a good remedy to my crippling anxiety is humor. I forked the GitHub DMCA repository and wiped it, and made a joke about DMCA. I did a pull request, but rejected it, as I wanted to further the joke. Somebody the next day didn't appear to like the joke and gave me a dislike, but I am going to try to ignore it, as the humor was worth it. I found the joke funny, it wasn't destructive, and it was a relief to not be in pain for the rest of the night because of it (by the way, please **do not** go out of your way and attack them for this, they probably just didn't get the joke, which is fine)

I got very little done today. I was still able to get my journaling done. I am having an early emergency appointment with my therapist tomorrow.

Today was a very bad day for development.

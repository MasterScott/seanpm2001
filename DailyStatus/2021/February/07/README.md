### Status update: February 7th 2021

I had a difficult, but successful day today. I worked on 2 new projects that I have been drafting, which is the next article in my February anti-Google campaign, and another project that can help people switch from one operating system to another by checking the programs you have installed, checking to see if they will work on the other system, and provide alternatives.

I also got work done on the Git-Image portion of my work. I stayed up really late to finish tonight. I have been dealing with a severe breathing problem today caused by anxiety, where it is harder to breath. I broke down further and further, and eventually needed over an hour and a half to recover.

I am now going to focus on finding another person to collaborate with me. What I am doing is no longer safe, and it is causing significant mental and physical damage. One person isn't supposed to manage a giant organization by themselves. I need help by getting a good contributor who can be a friend that helps get to the stuff I can't get to. 

I also did the usual work. I was going to expand on it and make monthly renovations, but I ran out of time and focus.

Today was a better day for development.

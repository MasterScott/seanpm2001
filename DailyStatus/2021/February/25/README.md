### Status update: February 25th 2021

I forgot to mention this yesterday, but I did an upgrade to the basis of my journaling project, making it the founding member of a Myrick family archive project. This shouldn't affect the journaling project very much, it will only serve as a brand name platform for it.

I got a lot done again today across various projects. I expanded my degoogling campaign further, although now over 65% of the repositories don't have a functional draft of their article yet, and I wasn't able to make any new articles today. It will take me until at least late March 2021 to fix this.

I also worked further on the nostalgia project today, and my usual Thursday game picture uploads. I played 1 game (City Story) for the longest duration to date today. The game is very enjoyable to me for some reason.

I am happy with how much progress I have been making lately, but it is also upsetting to me, as I raised the bar for myself a little too high by doing this (65 commits doesn't mean a rise in activity now, it takes more than 100 commits for the first rise now)

I spent a lot of time organizing projects today by forking them to organizations. I wasn't able to write any new articles today, but I still got a lot done again today.

Today was another extremely day for development.

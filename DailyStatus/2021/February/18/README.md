### Status update: February 18th 2021

I did a lot better again today. I got a bit done, including the usual work, writing 3 articles for my anti-Google campaign, and doing ProjectWiki work, along with some other extra tasks.

I continued my anti-Google campaign today. The articles weren't as high quality today (except for the first one) as I was set out to write 3 instead of 2 today, and couldn't find as much info. However, when researching AMP, I came across something that is now traumatizing me:

Moore's law (semiconductor capacity doubles every 2 years) is predicted to end in 2025. At the same time, Wirth's law (software is becoming slower more rapidly than hardware is getting better) is still going. With a mix of both of these together, it could spell really bad things for Computer Science. I am sure we won't go back to writing on cave walls, but something is going to have to be done about this. No more excuses. Our previous excuses were "Skeumorphism was removed, as it uses too much memory" yet at the same time, the flat interface uses up over 10x as much memory as that of a highly advanced UI (such as Windows Vista (less than 200 megabytes), or OS X 10.8 (less than 180 megabytes)) I fear that when this happens, more features are going to be removed, computers might be only to handle 1 program at a time, and the storage required for the 100+ gigabyte video games and other software will use up all the digital storage we have (compared to entire games that take over 30 minutes to beat and playable for weeks on end, taking up **only 30 kilobytes** (graphics, sound, and all) back in 1985 (like Super Mario Bros)) This can be mitigated if we start prioritizing performance over time again, and unfortunately it seems a bit rare. The Linux Kernel and many other open source solutions are in the right direction, but it could go bad. 

Today was a Thursday, and I spent a bit more time playing games, but it didn't affect my productivity very much. I have now noted from 4 days of experiments that sleeping outside of my room causes me to be more performant and focused (the 3 days I slept outside my room, I did exponentially better, the 1 day I slept in my bed, I did exponentially worse) I am trying to figure out if it is coincidence or not.

My laptop did not malfunction again today. I have also noticed that in the past 2 days (since February 17th 2021) something has changed, and my laptop is using a lot less CPU (it is staying below 10% overall CPU usage across all 8 cores for most of the time, originally, it stayed between 15 and 25% CPU usage across my octo-core CPU at all times) due to this, battery life has been better, and the fan has hardly been kicking on.

I am going to bed early again tonight.

Today was a good day for development.

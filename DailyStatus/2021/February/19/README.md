### Status update: February 19th 2021

I had a more difficult day today. I got inconsistent sleep last night, and I have been performing poorly today. I got the usual tasks done, along with the creation of 2 new articles in my anti-Google campaign, and an improvement I planned to the main anti-Google campaign repository.

Earlier this afternoon, I went to preview an SVG file (499 KB) I created about a month ago to test InkScape. I didn't realize that the image was actually a forkbomb (I classify it as malware for my computer) and the moment I opened it, my computer began to freeze up. I rushed to close it. If I was just a couple hundred milliseconds off, my laptop would have crashed. The image was above 16K resolution and contained improper SVG formatting. My computers RAM filled within a couple seconds, and the SWAP reached 1.9 GiB/2.0 GiB before I closed it. In total, the forkbombing process used over 4 gigabytes of memory in less than 6 seconds. I find it pretty ironic and funny that this image was a memory problem, as the image itself was about how inefficient the memory usage of another program (Google Chrome) is. I would show off the image, but I fear any way of viewing it will result in a forkbomb, and there is no way I can safely preview the image at the moment. I spent over 30 minutes getting SWAP usage back down to 532 mebibytes (MiB) RAM wasn't as much of an issue, as it cleared the moment I closed the image.

GitHub had a small change today, where new file commits tell you which branch you are on, which is understandable, but there is also now a "cancel changes" button, which I am confused on why it was added, as it just seems like a waste of a tab key press. Normally if I make an error, I would press the back button. It was a noticeable change, and now I am unsure if the button existed before, but said "cancel" instead of "cancel changes" these UI changes are weird.

I customized my contacts a bit later tonight, and finished up what I needed to be done, but I didn't go for any extra work tonight. I had a medical issue earlier that impaired me for a while. Further information will be available at a later date (??? or May 14th 2040)

Today was a below decent day for development.

### Status update: February 13th 2021

I didn't have the best day with development today. I got the very basics done, but not much else. Tonight, I had a new experiment, and it required alarms. I found that my laptop didn't come with a clock app by default, which is weird. I feel like this is one of those apps that should have been installed by default, and that if it couldn't be installed, other apps like Thunderbird, Thai X Terminal (Doesn't work for me) and the games shouldn't have been installed before this. There weren't any good clock apps on the Ubuntu software store, so I had to go with GNOME clocks. I played around with it for a bit. Some of the disadvantages it has are things like not being able to set a custom sound for alarms, and better options for snoozing alarms (once I snooze an alarm, it is basically the same as dismissing it) I like some things about it. I experimented with time zones on the clock app, and created a list of world clocks for most time zones around the world. The lowest time zone I could find was Hawaii (UTC -2 hours) and the furthest time zone I could find was New Zealand (UTC +21 hours) I later found out that the world clocks appear in the notification pane:

I didn't get too much done today, and I held off my journaling really late. I watched a movie with part of my family, as my parents were out of the house tonight. I later realized that the alarm system for the project I was doing was 1 hour off, and that I failed the project. Later on, after getting halfway through my journaling, I had a severe panic attack, and it caused a huge incident. For safety reasons, I can't talk about this any further right now.

This incident broke some of my repetition, the repetition it broke was the Khan Academy cycle. It is extremely rare for a consecutive project to break on me, and it took me a while to process how to get past this. I had to put off a lot of things to save time and recover tonight.

I hardly did anything today, I didn't have a very good day with development

### Status update: February 27th 2021

I got my 2nd COVID-19 shot today. Within the next 5 weeks, I will have ~95% immunity to COVID-19. I didn't have any side effects from it today, but another family member had lots of nausea and flu-like symptoms the next day for just a couple hours. I might get that as well, but it is still much better than the painful, lonely, helpless death of a COVID-19 patient.

I had a pretty difficult time working today. I spent over 6 hours playing the 2 games I play on Saturday (AdVenture Communist and AdVenture Capitalist) I hope to eventually curb this addiction. If it wasn't for the event going so slowly, I would have played even longer.

I got some work done today, but was a bit slow with writing documentation.

I cleaned my laptop last night, and now I can rule out the "laptop was just dirty" as the problem for the S, J, and K keys. I don't know how I will repair the keyboard. It would be nice to get a laptop with a mechanical keyboard (if a good one with all my specs existed) I had some times today where the key worked completely fine for 5 minutes, then went back to its old state of functionality.

I still got some work done today. I had some new project ideas today, 2 good, and 1 good but a bit controversial. I thought of an idea of a software tool that digs through your social media and finds racist/sexist/stupid posts and reports them to the user. I decided to go ahead and build it, but I had to make some notes for it.

Again, if GitHub didn't improve their servers recently to allow faster file processing, today would have been much harder.

Today was a decent day for development.

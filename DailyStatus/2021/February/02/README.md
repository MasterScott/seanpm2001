### Status update: February 2nd 2021

I had difficulty with procrastination, overheating, and stress yet tonight. I didn't fall behind in my journaling, but by the time I got to finishing GitHub work, I was completely distracted again, and had to quit to get ready for bed. This is the second time I have skipped the image naming process.

I spent way too much time playing games today, and I woke up late. I am really working on cutting down on this, but it is hard sometimes.

I didn't do very much today.

Today was not a good day for development.

### Status update: February 21st 2021

I have been in a much better mood recently. My mood was pretty good into the day. Some things that improved my mood were nostalgia from the Samsung: over the Horizon leitmotif songs, and the XPS 13 Ubuntu first boot animation (which I have considered on and off again to make my laptop do that every time I boot it up. Sure, it would take another 33 seconds, but it would add so much to it. I really am not in a rush for my computer to turn on, unless it takes more than a minute. I feel like it is something that I wouldn't get tired of, and in the case of when I would, I would just disable it.

However, past 2:40 pm, I started to have some environmental issues, and my completely happiness went away for several hours (although I was still in a good mood, with about 42-78% happiness, I wasn't 100% happy) this further got worse when I decided to hold off work for 1 project, which I can justify:

I held off work on my degoogle campaign today. I have noticed that articles haven't been as high quality recently, due to them being forced on me. I planned on doing 2 articles a day up to March 12th 2021 or later, but today I just decided to hold it off. This will delay the current roadmap to March 13th 2021, and it is likely going to be delayed further, as I don't think I can keep up the pace for this many days in a row. It is justified. As much as I would like to be a machine, that just isn't possible at the moment, and I need a break from time to time.

Additionally, my laptops battery has been having increasing problems this week. On day 1 with this laptop, the batterys reported capacity was 96.0% | recently, it has been getting worse, and on one day this week, it lost a full 4% capacity. My laptop can no longer last 4 hours with constant usage before having to be plugged in again (100% to 25%) over the course of my laptops life, the capacity has dropped from 96.0% to 83.6%, a full 12.4% reported drop. Unfortunately, Dell decided to make this laptop similar to a MacBook _lighter than air_, so I don't even know if it is possible to replace the battery without screwing everything up.

I worked on the private project a bit in depth today, so not as much development was done publicly on GitHub. I have also had a sharp increase in making a specific error (accidentally doing some button combination and publishing a commit before finishing the documentation) it is an odd project, and I quit early, as it is something I should spend less time on.

I tried out a "high performance multi-tasking" brain mode last night, I don't know why I stopped doing it. The pros outweigh the cons (slight increase in error rate, slight tension increase) I didn't have as many projects I wanted to do today, so I had a lesser high performance multi-tasking mode.

I have an appointment with my therapist again tomorrow. I am going to wake up earlier for it. I am hoping tomorrow will be a better day.

My headphones finally died today at 8:39 pm, they lasted nearly 2 months without having to be charged. There was a bit of an issue finding the charger, as I haven't charged them since early January, and now I am going to have to wait ~12.5 hours for them to charge. They should be fully charged by 9:36 am tomorrow. I really would recommend this pair of headphones: Letscom 100 hour bluetooth headphones. They only cost $30.00, and they are the best pair of headphones I have ever had. With this rate of battery life (even with daily usage of 30 minutes to 12 hours a day) I will only need to charge the headphones 7-8 times a year. Here is my estimate info on the charging time: estimated 12.5 hours to full charge (based on statistic: 15 minutes of charging for 2 hours of battery = 1/8 charging ratio = 100 hours/8 ratio = 12.5 hours of estimated charging time.

Due to issues today, I had to stay up pretty late to get everything I needed to get done, done. This didn't seem like a problem last night, so hopefully it isn't one tonight as well.

I worked on the basic required tasks today, along with some new image projects (recursion, battery) and other work.

Today was another below decent day for development.

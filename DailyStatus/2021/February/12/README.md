### Status update: February 12th 2021

So last night, I got suspended on GitHub. I knew that the consequence for mass-following people would be suspension, as I saw the follower bots get suspended and come back. I just didn't expect a long delay. I had to verify my email address, and now I know not to follow anyone at random. I am fearful of a second strike, so I laid low today. This now 100% confirms that this strategy is bad. I would go and unfollow, but it would take far too long. Don't do it yourself. I wonder why it doesn't just stop you at some point instead of suspending you.

When trying to receive the verification email, I found that my ProtonMail inbox was completely full with nearly 95000 emails from GitHub. I rarely check my email, so I didn't know that this was such a huge consequence when watching projects. Whenever I star a project, I also watch it, so there were 1-8 emails being sent per minute. I thought it was only for things like pull requests and new releases, not every single action that is done to any part of the project. Unfortunately, ProtonMail has no way of deleting more than 50 emails at a time, so I had to configure the filter to automatically mark GitHub notifications as spam, and then I can delete the spam folder once it gets full again, as I can just clear it. Unfortunately, it is still really slow, and takes an hour to delete 9000 emails.

Today was the end of the 19 days of suffering I have endured. 

I hardly did anything today, I mostly laid low and relaxed

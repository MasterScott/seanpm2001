### Status update: February 3rd 2021

I continued to have difficulty with procrastination, overheating, and stress yet again today. I didn't fall behind in my journaling, but my journaling work was scattered. I didn't start until past 2:30 pm.

I have been taking advantage of spreading awareness to degoogling on GitHub by populating the [#degoogle-your-life](https://github.com/topics/degoogle-your-life) topic. I spent a lot of time working on an article on the problems of Google Chrome, and ChromeOS today, how bad it is, and how to get away from it. I spent nearly 2 hours writing it.


I didn't do very much today.

Today was a better day for development.

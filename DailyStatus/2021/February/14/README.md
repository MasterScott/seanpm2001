### Status update: February 14th 2021

Today is Valentines Day 2021. I didn't get out of the house at all again today, other than going around my own property. I had another difficult day today. I had a calming start, and procrastinated a little bit, but eventually got work done. I didn't do anything but the very basics. I had a huge struggle to start my journal, and I had lots of panics when trying to start. I worked late, and eventually finished late.

Not much was done on GitHub today. I am still fearful of following anyone. As part of my F4F (Follow for Follow) rule, I followed 2 recent people who followed me who I hadn't followed first. I am being very careful who I follow. I am hoping this doesn't cause an issue.

I hardly did anything today, I didn't have a very good day with development again today.

### Status update: February 16th 2021

Today was a day where I had to do work besides plain uploads, so I continued my degoogling campaign today, along with the usual work.

For my gaming schedule, I cut Idle Miner Tycoon and saved myself lots of time today, although I played the other game (Bit City) a lot longer. I have officially moved this game slot from weekly to monthly. The new schedule is that I play this game on the first Tuesday of each month. Some other games that are causing conflict with my schedule that I am working on are AdVenture Communist/AdVenture Capitalist.

I have noticed that GitHub has been processing data much faster as of yesterday and today. Normally, it takes 4-5 minutes to process 100 files, and now I am able to have the files processed over 2x faster than I upload them. For reference, it took less than 5 seconds to process 16 files.

I have noticed a massive performance and mood increase in the past 2 days. I don't know what caused it. Today, I cleared a lot of my notes out, but a lot of work still needs to be done. I made progress again today. I am hoping to continue this level of performance.

I am going to bed early again tonight (before 11:00 pm) so I quit early. I got nearly everything I wanted to get done today done.

Today was another great day for development.

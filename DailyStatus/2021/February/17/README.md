### Status update: February 17th 2021

I wasn't as productive today, but I still got some work done. I got distracted very easily today.

Today, I did the usual tasks, and worked heavily on articles that are part of my anti-Google campaign, which is relatively successful (so far, all 16 articles have gained 300+ views, 2 stars (18 when counting the ones I added) and 80+ clones from February 3rd 2021 to February 17th 2021. This may not seem like much, but it is the record for the month, as most people who visit my profile don't stay very long)

Today, I spent nearly 2 hours writing an article on YouTube. I originally wanted to be careful on this, but I decided to go all out. If I had more time, and had the desire to continue writing, I would have gone further today. Also, my article on Google Classroom received a star before I even added the article, so I had to write an article for that as well today, which I spent nearly an hour on. Both articles will still be updated with new details, and also translated into many different languages, so there is a lot to go.

This morning, my laptop had a minor malfunction. When I used Windows 10, the malfunctions happened at least twice a week, so it is nice to have so few problems that require a restart. I noticed that something was using my microphone, but I couldn't find what. I checked every program and closed every program. I tried an answer on [ask ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/a/1249744) but it didn't help. I also noticed that my F1-F4 keys weren't working, so I decided to restart, and it fixed both issues. Windows was worse. I remember on my final months of Windows 10, the keyboard would completely stop functioning (except for the power button) and restarting would trigger an update (basically, in this time period, Windows seemed like it was purposefully making my computer inoperable to force me into updating) this happened multiple times, and the operating system did other bad things as well.

I am going to bed early again tonight.

Today was a decent day for development.

### Status update: February 23rd 2021

I did an unusual pattern of working today, doing part of my GitHub work first, due to the profile already being open from my therapist visit. 

So last night, I found out that I can get paid for my albums on BandCamp via donation. Currently, it is the only way I can get payment online. So I decided to partially revive the MEDOS project and add a link to the album.

I have decided to do my Git-Image work (work done for Git-Image profile repositories, such as Tiny Tower images, GNOME System Monitor images, GitHub images, etc.) before 1:30 pm each day. It is really helpful to get these out of the way early

I created some new GitHub organizations today, I was really surprised that some of these names weren't taken. I now can categorize my projects even better. 

I have recently finalized my plotting for a plan I have been developing for a week, which is a nostalgia-based operating system for a special device that lets you experience nostalgia in the most strong way possible. I have figured out how to manipulate the human mind with various factors to make someone actually feel like they are in one of their past positive memories. Research is still needed, I am still testing this. I have been researching this since 2015 (the year I experienced nostalgia for the first time, and have been experiencing on a daily basis ever since) unfortunately, the device needed to make the operating system work isn't technically possible yet, some other projects need development first, notably:

* CompuSmell - The CompuSmell project is a programming project that allows programmable odors to be exported from a computer (other than the smell of a hot CPU or dusty fan)

I was a bit all over the place today, and I got a lot done. I started a huge process for a project (NostaliaProject) where I will go through tons of media tomorrow. I have been doing research on this advanced idea, where there is a device designed to give people completely pure nostalgia for up to 12 hours a week. One of the main things that is blocking me from truly starting is one of the technologies (CompuSmell) is not yet developed enough to make this work.

I got a lot done today, and early on. I worked a lot on the Nostalgia project and the new operating system, along with the creation and setup of a couple GitHub organizations. I also wrote 2 more articles against Google, but to of low quality, even with a 1 day hiatus. They had some effort put into them, I held them off until the end, and I was in a rush, so they didn't turn out as good as they should have on their first draft.

I am starting to get active interaction with my projects. Today, while working on the NOstalgia operating system project, a GitHub user left a star withn 30 minutes of its creation. This process normally takes 7 days to 365 days before this recent explosion due to my 1.2k following.

Today was a good day for development.

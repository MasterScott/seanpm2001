### Status update: February 5th 2021

I got less done today, but I had a planned document on what to do today. I marked the entries with 2 colors, a red sharpee for the most important entries, and a green highlighter for the optional entries. I finished all the high priority work by 5:31 pm, and earned $10.00, as part of the challenge of finishing before 6:00 pm. I later went on to do the other planned work, which I finished at 8:30+ pm. It would have been completely perfect if I didn't forget to make a status file for today.

Today, I further worked on my article against Google Chrome. I began to translate the article into different languages today. Ironically, I have to use Google Translate for this, as unfortunately, there are no other good translating services for what I need. I have tried Bing Translate, but it isn't as good, and I have tried DeepL, but it only had 4 languages when I originally tried it (it has more now, but still less than 12, compared to Google Translates 106 languages, as of 2018) machine translation is currently inaccurate, as it is far from perfect. I trust that it is still somewhat readable, but I am going to need contributors to help me find and fix translation errors in all translations from English. Unfortunately, I don't have my own translator yet, so if you want to help, you are going to have to provide sources on the used words, and sources on their usage and guide me through it, as I know very few words in languages other than English and can't form a full sentence in anything but English.

I chose Polish as one of the languages, even though it isn't the most common. One reason was because the top repository in the [#degoogle-your-life](https://github.com/topics/degoogle-your-life) topic is in Polish, and I wanted to try and connect with the 19 stargazers of this project. The main reason though was to add support for as many languages as possible, so that anyone can get informed on this subject.

The article is now in 10 languages. I have been getting a really high number of people/bots cloning the repository, with 31 cloners, and 19 unique visitors, but with February 6th 2021 data, I only have 1 view. I am extremely confused. I haven't downloaded this repository once yet, and it says 19 people have. Are view counts on a repositories traffic interdependent with the number of times a project is cloned. 

I also did the usual work.

I didn't do very much today.

Today was a better day for development.

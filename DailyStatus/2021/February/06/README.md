### Status update: February 6th 2021

I got much less done today,

Today, I further worked on my article against Google Chrome. However, I started working on the drafts for an article about ChromeOS. It is currently under development, just 5 things need to be fixed, then I will release V1.0 and create the repository. Today was a hard day for development, but a good day for my health, although the good day starts tomorrow.

I got my first COVID-19 vaccine today. I didn't have any side effects. From family experience, the second shot gave my grandpa the flu for an hour, which is so much more livable than dying completely alone in a ventilator from COVID-19, where not even the doctors can hear your final screams. I feel like getting COVID-19 is one of the 5 worst ways to go out. If you are able to get the vaccine, you should try and get it. It is much better than a gruesome death. From personal experience with my family, there have been no side effects with the first shot, and only minor side effects with the second shot. Also, from personal experience, if you are getting a vaccine, be prepared for it and don't think too much of it. Every time a doctor or nurse gave me a vaccine, it has been painless, unless I were to look at the needle. If you look away from the needle and never make sight of it until after you are done, it will be very painless. This time when getting a vaccine, I didn't feel any sting. The last few times with this strategy, I had a mild sting. You might be sore for a while afterwards (I wasn't as sore this time) but shots really aren't that painful. I got the pfizer vaccine today. Thank you to the people working at BioNTech in Hainz Germany who created this vaccine, and for the US pfizer distribution.

I had some issues with tension and focus today, this is not related to the vaccine, I have been having this issue for a few weeks now due to something else. It made it hard to work today until I finally got into a better mood at around 4:00 pm, and began writing better documentation and planning better.

However, I got out of the house for a long time tonight and really fell behind on work. I had to stay up past 10:40 pm to finish my journaling, all the while I couldn't listen to music, as my computer was acting weird and not letting me enable bluetooth, the toggle was completely broken. I am unsure if this is a coincidence, but every time I plug my laptop into a different outlet, it has some problem, like the battery dropping 2-8% instantly, or bluetooth not working.

I wasn't able to finish my Git-image based tasks or start a project I wanted to start.

I didn't do very much today.

Today was a better day for development.

### Status update: February 23rd 2021

GitHub had a nice notable change today, syntax highlighting is now present while writing new files. This is incredibly helpful, and I am glad it finally got added.

Today, I continued normally and did further work to the nostalgia project, and created 4 new degoogle articles. For whatever reason, the one on Google Analytics became extremely glitched out, and had problems nearly everywhere. I couldn't star the project, I couldn't get away from the "can't get commits at this time" message, I could fork it, but I had to do it directly, and I couldn't star the fork (I could only "watch" the fork and the original project) further: discussions were broken {I couldn't downvote or upvote, but the downvote button was removed, I couldn't pin, I couldn't add emotes} I had to refresh before doing anything, as it would get stuck trying to load the file. I even tried deleting the repository and recreating it, but it still had the same issues (possibly due to the name) I have never had such a glitchy repository. There was a lot of broken ness there.

I caught up on some downloads today that I have held off for a bit, and I changed my desktop wallpaper to this beautiful picture from Pakistan, which I feel should be the Bliss wallpaper for Linux. Windows XP Bliss is still extremely iconic, but I feel like this one would be good for Linux, and it could help some people overcome the bias of Middle East Asia being all deserts and having little to no greenery. This was the most beautiful picture from nature I have seen all year so far. I also organized my desktop today in preparation for this being my new wallpaper for a while.

I worked further on the nostalgia project today, making it a more functional index of nostalgia research and a source of personal nostalgia as well for when I am feeling down, or when I feel like there is more bad in the world than good/nothing good left in the world (when I get too depressed)

I did my work in the same order as yesterday, where Git-image work was done first. I had another very successful day today. I wanted to reach 153+ commits again today, but unfortunately, I didn't make it to this goal. I feel like it will be hard to get this far again very soon, as I had an advantage with the Nostalgia Project and the resources it has (the project had enough capable commits to reaching 153+ commits per day)

Today was another good day for development.

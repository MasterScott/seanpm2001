### Status update: February 15th 2021

Today, I archived my GitHub status posts into my profile repository. This task has been held off for a while. It felt good finally getting this task done.

I got to work earlier today, and was much more focused and in a much better mood. Yesterday, I adopted a new work model, which is that programming commits are not a daily requirement, but have to be done at least once every 3-5 days. This was done to reduce some stress. The idea is that code commits aren’t a daily requirement, but a every 3-5 days requirement. I have noticed that most people on GitHub don’t commit changes every single day, so I decided to go a bit easier on myself and lax the requirement, so ideas aren’t as forced. The usual daily tasks are still required.

Yesterday, I went back into food research, and I have decided to go Vegetarian again, a second attempt. I was again reminded of the barbaric agriculture process. I hope to make it permanent this time. If it was possible, I would go vegan, but there are way too many dependencies for me, and it will limit me by over 80% it will stick better this time, as I have become even more persistent on tasks since the last attempt (lasted: 1 day)

I am going to bed early again tonight. I am proud of my accomplishments today. Another new daily task has been added, which is to archive status updates.

Today was a great day for development.

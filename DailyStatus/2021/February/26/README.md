### Status update: February 26th 2021

My productivity waned today. I have procrastinated a lot today, and didn't get as much done. Yesterday, my laptops keyboard started to have problem, and they have gotten much worse today. I didn't expect my keyboard to brea sso quicly [Sic] it has been acting weird. The s key doesn't always press, but when it does, it sometimes presses twice, or capitalizes itself (without me pressing CTRL or CAPS LOCK) the K key is having problems along with the J key, and the I, and A keys might also be having problems. It has been a bit stressful, as I don't want to believe that I already broke this laptops keyboard, since it hasn't even been a year yet (it normally takes me 14 months or longer to completely wear out a computer keyboard due to how often I type. If you don't know anybody who casually breaks a keyboard over the course of 14 months from constant usage, now you can say you know at least 1 person) 

I worked on various new GitHub organizations today (just 3) I use them as a way of organizing and categorizing projects.

GitHub added a new small feature today, where files can be attached when editing a markdown file. I have not yet tested how this works, I don't know where it would place the file.

I decided to make my GitHub star and follows document into a daily GitHub progress report. It has been expanded today, and now has its own template.

I didn't get very much done today. I spent over 2 hours today forking and starring projects and setting up new organizations. There wasn't much I planned on doing, but I have noted that I need to work on various aspect of the SNU Programming Tools platform, as it is severely underdeveloped.

I wrote 2 new degoogle article, after some not wanting to do it, resulting in some poor draft documents. I feel like I should stick to 1 a day instead of 2.

Today was an OK for development.

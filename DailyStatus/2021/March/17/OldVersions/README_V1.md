### Status update: March 17th 2021

I had the tiredness problem again today, but it went away pretty quickly. I have some work I can do, but at the same time, I feel like I don't know what to do with myself. This feeling of pain went away ~~in~~ about 2 and a half hours into my day.

I did a hard drive backup today, and also updated the Jewels repository, the first time in almost 2 full months. It needed some updates. I also updated several other repositories.

It seems like every month, I gain new protocols that I have to add to each project. Lately, I have been developing them a bit faster than normal. The most notable changes so far this year were the January 2021 anti-DRM sticker and discussion updates, as of recently, starting near the Ides of March (March 15th 2021) I have developed new protocols for the `.github` folder, including methods for issue and discussion archival, privacy policies, GitHub label data in YAML format, social media preview images, and a sponsor button image. I spent a lot of time today optimizing and upgrading several repositories to this set of changes.

Early in the afternoon, my `a` and `s` keys got bad, the `a` key got to its worst point yet, where even pressing so hard on the `a` key that I could feel the white sensor underneath the key, it still wouldn't register. This was a severe issue today, and it was very frustrating to deal with. I tried 2 keyboards (a USB keyboard and a bluetooth keyboard) both didn't meet up to expectations, as they didn't fit on the laptop, and it felt weird using 2 keyboards at once, and it made work 10-100x slower. Luckily, after an hour of this, when I went back to trying to deal with the usual keyboard, it was now functioning perfectly and felt really smooth.

> As of March 17th 2021 at 9:40 pm, the key issues have not returned.

I got work done in various projects today. I plan on trying to go to bed a little bit earlier tonight. I want to get back to a somewhat normal schedule again and not go to sleep at ~12:25 am to ~1:34 am anymore.

Some other old projects I modified today were Tiny Tower Vegas images, but most notably, BGemJam, which hasn't been updated in over 9 months (since June 2020) I also created another project organization tonight, this time only 1 instead of 4. This organization is for development of the BGemJam game.

Today was a good day for development.

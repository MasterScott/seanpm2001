### Status update: March 3rd 2021

I had a very hard time getting to sleep last night, as I was generating lots of ideas and notes. My day started off with me feeling down, but after getting outside in the sunlight, everything turned around. I got a good amount of sunlight and it completely changed my mood.

Today, I worked on the usual projects, and worked on my journaling earlier in the day. I also updated my iBlast project and renovated it a bit. This was the first time in over 8 months that I worked on this project.

My S key is doing a lot better today, it completely turned around from last night, which is weird. It is now at the functionality level of 6 days ago. Later on in the afternoon, I had help, and I managed to have my keyboard fixed. All it took was a clean, unused paintbrush to wipe the dust out of the key. I thought it would take me 8 hours to get used to using the keyboard normally again, but it only took less than 2 and a half hours.

I did heavy programming and documentation work today in various projects and got a ton done. I stayed up a little bit late to finish up.

Today was a somewhat decent day for development.

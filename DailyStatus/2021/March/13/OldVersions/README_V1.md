### Status update: March 13th 2021

I had a severe gaming addiction problem today that jeopardized my nighttime work schedule. My keyboard is also still having severe problems, most notably with the `Aa` key.

I got some work done in various projects again today, and my keyboard became fully functional over time. I stayed up late and got a lot done.

I revived work on some old projects today, such as AudiBass Manager, and SNU TV, as I had ideas for the projects.

During finishing up, I ran low on time, as I got stuck being distracted by working on my Patreon account. I apparently will have to change every `FUNDING.yml` file now, as the original name no longer works.

I have recently fallen in love with YAML for some reason, and I am trying to find an effective way to use it for large projects.

Today was an OK day for development.

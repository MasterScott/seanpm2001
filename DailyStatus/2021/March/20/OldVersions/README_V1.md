### Status update: March 20th 2021

I had a poor nights sleep last night, but woke up on my own early, with a little (about 30 minutes) less than 8 hours of sleep. This hardly proved to be a problem today, as I stayed productive, although I had a pretty dull day.

Today, I had my usual Saturday gaming sessions, I had some control, but the addiction would still spiral out of control. Luckily the second game I play that caused a problem last Saturday stopped working a little bit in, due to an ad crashing and a recent password change to the games associated account, so I got really lucky on this, and had time to get more work done.

I got more projects up to standard today, and updated documentation. I also started a new project that I developed the idea for, which is a busybox bluetooth companion called "Blue Dentures" (dentures but with bluetooth instead of whitetooth) I only started development, as with most projects, I currently don't have the capabilities to go very far with it on my own without help from others. I do NOT know how to write Assembly at a high level, and this project requires it to read, decode, and execute (rd&e is also the process of how a hard drive works) certain bands of binary data directly from the BlueTooth device(s) it is targetting.

I helped around the house today, and visited with family a lot. I worked on a new NimbleBit organization and made over 85 forks today. This is a project that has been delayed for a while. I still have plenty of projects to work on at the moment.

I was in a rush to finish all documentation, GitHub, and laptop work before 11:45 pm tonight again. I am hoping I can get a better nights sleep tonight.

Tomorrow is my 20th birthday (March 21st 2001 (same exact day the Game Boy Advance was released, I have found this to be a cool fun fact since discovery in 2018) to March 21st 2021) I made some customizations to my profile to celebrate tonight.

Today was an OK day for development.

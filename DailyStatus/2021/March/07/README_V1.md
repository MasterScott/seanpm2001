### Status update: March 7th 2021

I had another relaxing day again today. I spent a lot of time and had fun playing Supercell games. In Clash of Clans, I upgraded several walls, the battle machine, an archer tower, and a golem, and had 6 wins. In Boom Beach, I attacked 2 hammerman headquarter bases successfully due to level 2 scorchers and speed serum. In Clash Royale, I played briefly just to collect some rewards, and in Hay Day, I made lots of progress, and had one of my longest sessions to date.

I got to work on other projects really late today, and dealt with several keys on my keyboard having problems, fixing all of them (as of 3:34 pm) with the exception of the S key having some problems again. The keys that I fixed were `a` and `left ctrl`

I did the usual image work, and started a new organization for software library projects. I got distracted and spent several hours working on a project I held off: a library for connecting multiple programs together (ProTraApp)

I downloaded some videos of Konosuba today, as I gained significant interest in the Anime on March 5th 2021 that is still ongoing.

I got a ton done today. Today was one of my 4 best days of the year for commit count. I am going to bed slightly earlier tonight due to a therapist appointment in the morning.

Today was a good day for development.

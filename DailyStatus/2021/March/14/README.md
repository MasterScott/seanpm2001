### Status update: March 14th 2021

Happy Pi day. I got a lot of work done today and had a productive day. I worked on various projects.

Last night, I finally nearly finished set-up of my Patreon account. Today, I spent a lot of time setting up and fixing sponsor buttons on projects, and archiving issues and discussions into the `/.github` directory. I am still working on setting up a payment method on Patreon, I have a plan to create a repository related to sponsor info, I will plan that later tonight.

Today, I worked on over 18 different projects, and as said above, mostly just archived my old issues and discussions. I have been in a good mood today.

I have been going through old notes and trying to finish projects today. I have a lot of stuff that has gone undone, and I have been catching up on it lately.

By the way, for anyone interested who is from Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, South America (Antarctica? I feel [Tux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_(mascot)) is the only Linux user in Antarctica) or anywhere besides the US, commit times are an hour off, due to daylight savings time going into effect at `2:00 am` this morning. I really don't like the time change, it doesn't help me, and it only makes more work and more stress for me. It would be nice if the US would get rid of it already, as I feel that it is extremely outdated (like many other things here, even in government, where some primary systems are still 16 bit and using COBOL in 2021) 

I haven't mentioned this for a bit, but I have been hosting my ironic SVG forkbomb since March 12th 2021 on GitHub. If you are interested, you can view it here (not linking to the SVG file, as I fear it could still forkbomb, even through GitHub, as I have seen a similar effect with PDF files. Please **only run these files inside a virtual machine with enough host memory.**) [ZIP file link](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SVG_Forkbombs/tree/main/SVG_Forkbombs/Categories/Technical/Irony/FirefoxVChrome/ZIP)

I hope to get back to work on the code distancing and ProTraApp projects soon.

Today was an OK day for development.

### Status update: March 19th 2021

I had a long day today. The house is now emptier, and I have more work to do.

Today, due to excessive procrastination, I didn't get to GitHub work until past 8:00 pm. I had to go at a much faster pace to get everything done, and I was prepared to extend work up to 1:00 am if necessary. Luckily I didn't have to do that this time.

I have a new laptop being ordered now that arrives in May, it is a clone of my current laptop, and is to be used as a backup. I have now spent more on Linux laptops than I have on Windows laptops, and I hope the ~$2,800.00 spent on Linux machines also contributes to the message to Dell and others that Linux is the future.

I worked at a faster pace tonight, that felt about 5-6 times the speed of yesterday. I made a lot more progress on the `.github` folder modernization across projects.

I didn't get much programming work done today, I am still falling behind on this, although I am mostly done with the `.github` folder now, so I will have more time. Tomorrow is a known day to have time issues, and there is still some `.github` folder work, but not as much as when I started.

Today was a decent day for development.

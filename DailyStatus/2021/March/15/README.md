### Status update: March 15th 2021

I had a good nights sleep last night only to wake up to a tragic loss. My Koi I have had for 8 years died overnight due to shock (because we had to move the fish to clean the fishtank) the other 2 fish survived. It was a very sad morning for me, as this fish was 9 years old, and I have had it since the end of 5th grade, when my teacher gifted it to me. I really wish I would have kept it in the dirty tank so it could live anothr day. The funeral will happen sometime tonight.

I had to move past it today, although every time I walked near the fishtank, I felt very hurt.

<!--

Comic idea:

Person 1: Don't be koi with me
Person 2 (presumably me): *runs away crying*
Person 3: Dude, he lost a fish today

Today, I had a very long gaming session. Tomorrow, I have 2 morning appointments, so I might have less time again. I worked on more sponsor projects today, along with the usual image work. I finished setup of some of my goals for the United Autism Rights organization project, and wrote 2 project wikis. I also made a repository regarding sponsor info.

I tried to open Okular today, and found that it was corrupted. I feared that there was a possibility for software rot on Linux as well as Windows, but with further research, I found that somebody published an unstable release to the latest/stable branch, and the app somehow auto-updated (even though I have auto-updates turned off) other people had the same problem, so for now, I can't use Okular until it is fixed, which sucks, as it is my favorite PDF viewer (even back on my final year(s) of Windows 10)

I worked late again tonight, hopefully I can wake up on time in the morning.

Today was an OK day for development.

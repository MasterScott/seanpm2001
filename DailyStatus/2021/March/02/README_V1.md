### Status update: March 2nd 2021

I had a very unproductive day today due to my excessive Idle Miner Tycoon session, which was hard to quit. Luckily, I play again in **34 days** so it shouldn't be a worry for a while, although I need to get better control over my addiction.

I didn't start work today until after 6:00 pm. I didn't get too much done, but I laid some of the groundwork for some projects, and did well in personal projects, getting IMT out of the way until April 5th 2021.

I spent some other time doing some customizing and sorting, but I held my journaling off until pretty late before finalizing for the night. Today wasn't the best day for development, but it wasn't the worst, as I came up with many new ideas today, and got some work done.

My S key deteriorated a lot tonight, and it was really hard to work. I now have to copy and paste the letter s at times just to work.

Today was a somewhat decent day for development.

### Status update: March 21st 2021

Today is my 20th birthday. I treated it as a normal day.

I have had no keyboard issues for a few days now. I have noted today that the comments pane in LibreOffice has been closed during the working duration of the keyboard, so I suspect it may be a suspect.

I got better sleep tonight. I woke up and got my gaming sessions over quickly, and visited and texted family members for my birthday and as a check-up.

I have been having growing touchpad issues on my laptop. I am hoping it doesn't get as bad as the a key once was.

I was in a lesser better mood today, although I had a euphoric burst later at night. I tried getting everything done early, but I dragged everything on too long due to distractions.

My headphones died for the 2nd time tonight, they started at 10:33 pm with 1% battery left, and later died. THey lasted over 3 weeks this time, although I didn't fully charge them this time. They still lasted pretty long with 13 hours of charging over 3 weeks. I am charging them overnight tonight.

It has been a bit difficult to sleep at night lately, and hard to wake up. I have an appointment in the morning, and I am hoping I can be awake on time for it.

Other than my personal life, I got a lot done on GitHub today on the subject of template creation and project funding and documentation. Although I didn't do any programming today. I have a lot of similar work planned for tomorrow.

I got the rest of my current Firefox profile tasks out of the way today with the creation of a Tetris128 development organization project.

I learned how to screen capture on Ubuntu early this morning, and got footage of the Patreon 404 page. Unfortunately, Ubuntu limits recordings to 30 seconds, so I didn't get the whole animation.

Today was the first time this month where I worked on more than 25 repositories in a single day, so I needed to re-organize my data. Currently, I am averaging ~1002 commits per month for the year (even though the years not even a quarter over yet) as I have surpassed 12000 commits today (and I ended at `12023` commits)

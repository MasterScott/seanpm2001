### Status update: March 6th 2021

I had a relaxing day today. It was a Saturday, so I knew I wouldn't get to work until later on. I relaxed and played AdVenture Capitalist and AdVenture Communist, got exercise, and also visited outside. I didn't get to my GitHub work until after 4:00 pm.

Recently, I hit 101 followers on GitHub. That dropped to 100, then yesterday it dropped to 99. It was a bit disappointing. Today, it rose by 5 to 104 (it is up to 105 as of 8:35 pm)

Today, I worked on the usual image projects, but didn't do them in the new order again today. I decided that it is more productive to name the Linux screenshots during the upload of the "Linux" screenshots. I don't know why I found the other way productive, I feel that was just a placebo effect to GitHub servers increasing speed, and increased focus with less time reading Wikipedia and not working.

Today, I finalized the update to the code distancing project I have been working on for over a week. I put a ton of work into this update, and it is nice to be up to date, however, I have a lot of new plans that require over double the work of what I did, so it will take at least 2-3 weeks or longer to do this next update. It is still progress made. I got really creative with this project, and I think it contributed to the humor of the jokes.

I had a family member review the project, they seem to have liked it. I repurposed the text I sent and used it as a work as a quick access portal for beginners.

I was very distracted while working for the last 2 hours tonight, due to watching a movie with my family.

Today was a good day for development.

### Status update: March 12th 2021

I had a bad day with development today, but with some good parts. I woke up really early today due to a nightmare, and even with the extra time, my gaming sesion went on for too long (up until around 2:30 pm, just like last Friday)

I got several small things done today, but had to skip image naming, ProTraApp work, and some other projects. I still got a decent amount done, but I suffered with depression, and my keyboard becoming extremely unresponsive after 6:00 pm

I am going to bed earlier tonight. I hope to fix the keyboard issue and have a better day tomorrow.

Today was a bad/OK day for development.

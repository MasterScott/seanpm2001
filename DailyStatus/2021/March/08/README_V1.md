### Status update: March 8th 2021

I had a good day again today. I relaxed a lot this morning, and had a meeting with my therapist this morning. Although I had an extremely hard time sleeping last night, I mansged to get enough sleep to have a good day.

Today, I had a very long set of gaming sessions, but I wrote notes while playing, and quit at a somewhat reasonable time. I continued to multi-task, and got a lot done in a few projects.

I did heavy work on ProTraApp today, adding lots of support for MacOS. I have been losing a lot of followers today. I lost 2 followers overnight (down to 104) and it ha gone down to 103 later on.

While working today, I was randomly signed out of GitHub. This was confusing to me. I logged back in, there was no prompt to change my email, and no notification telling me I did something wrong, so I assume it was either a glitch, or too many organizations were signed in across too many Firefox profiles, or something else.

Today was another good day for development.

### Status update: March 10th 2021

I had a good day again today. I got a lot done, and raised the bar on my commit euphoria again (I know that commits aren't the best indicator of progress, but the high commit count still gives me more false euphoria/serotonin to keep me going a little bit stronger)

I worked on several projects again today, but most prominently on my Program Traveler App library, my SMS messaging article, and my GitHub images archive. So today when starting work on the GitHub images project, I got really confused for nearly 20 minutes, and couldn't figure out at all why 4 categories were missing, and the README was different. After several methods and lots of traversing, I found that I was in my GNOME System Monitor image repo, and not my GitHub image repo. I have considered putting up a warning for myself, but I feel like doing so would open up warnings across various repositories and combinations of repositories. Hopefully this incident is a good enough reminder for now.

My keyboard had absolutely no issues today. The keys performed well without having to be cleaned. I have learned to not eat or drink anything while using my laptop, not even 5 minutes before.

I worked really late today, and got a lot done.

Today was another great day for development.

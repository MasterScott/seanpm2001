### Status update: March 5th 2021

I had a much more difficult day today. I woke up really early (before 7:00 am) and got less than 6 hours of sleep. I then suffered a severe video game addiction that took me over 3 hours to conquer, and then I slowly did work, until I became nauseated and became unstable through digital media manipulation. Just a usual bad day.

I started playing a new game today (Egg Inc.) and became incredibly addicted to it. I didn't get everything I wanted to get done today done. I did my journaling late, and did the image upload process in the reverse order (Linux.screenshots after "Linux" (Android).screenshots) but I still got it done.

I did some experimenting tonight and found out what makes my posts "automatically" submit themselves. The combination I now know to avoid is `CTRL` + `[ENTER]`

Today could have gone completely different if I would have ended my addiction on time. I tried to get some work done tonight, but I couldn't do everything I wanted to do.

I still managed to get a lot done today, working on nearly all my planned projects. I only have 32 more commits to make to the code-distancing project before I can publish the next release, I spent a lot of extra time on this during Family game and movie night tonight.

Today was a good day for development.

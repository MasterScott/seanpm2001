### Status update: March 11th 2021

I had a good day again today. I did heavy amounts of work again today, but not as much as yesterday. I didn't have keyboard issues today, other than a really frustrating 1-2 hour time period, where 7 different keys weren't working correctly:

```
Problems:

A - [MOST SEVERE] (1)

D - [Severe/Very mild) (2) NEW: E (3)

S, RCTRL, LCTRL FN - [Mild] (6) (7)

Other - [OK/Good]
```

I gave myself a huge promotion today with 3 alt accounts (my only alt account, and 2 family accounts, with their permission) I am only mentioning this since it took over 1 hour to do. I am trying to gain recognition, so I can get help with my projects. I have been working on this in bursts for a while, as I have way too much work for myself to handle.

I published the first 2 official releases of ProTraApp today, and did work on various projects, including renewed work on SNU Translate, which I brought back from the dead (last commit before today was in September 2020, so not too far gone) I am starting to get further into the psychology field, I have been defining various thought processes lately. I am also considering resuming work on my degoogle campaign. After today, my portal to all my degoogle projects is now in the top 3 for the #degoogle-your-life GitHub tag.

I have also been planning work on my opinions directory, adding content to it, but I have so much other work I have been working on instead.

Today was another great day for development.

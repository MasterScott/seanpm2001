### Status update: March 4th 2021

I had a more difficult day today. I didn't get good direct sunlight, and my mood was only a 6th of what it was yesterday. I still got some work done, but not at a very fast pace.

My laptops battery is the next target I am dealing with. Yesterday it still really dropped fast despite an achievement of overall idle CPU usage not reaching 2% (even with killing `tracker-miner-fs` which I have to do every day. What I do every day: I run this command:

```shell
tracker reset --hard
```

followed by:

```shell
y
```

normally in the morning, all 8 CPU cores are trading turns being at 20-80% each until I kill this 1 process (tracker-miner-fs) I didn't have to do that yesterday for the CPU, but I still ran it anyway, as it also clears up nearly a gigabyte of RAM)

Earlier in the day today, I made a massive update to my GitHub profile README. Version 6 is the first update in over a month. It adds many new sections of data, and 9 new images.

I started an experiment I have been considering today, which is adding monthly, yearly, and all-time `README.md` files for image projects and other projects. I started with 2 repositories today as a test with only 6 `README.md` files and so far, it isn't looking good. I have been low on time today due to procrastination, and the first set took me over 37 minutes, so I didn't have time for the second set. I think I am going to have to do as much as I can every day to keep up.

I got a lot work done in the end, as I was working quickly. I worked more on the code-distancing project, and wrote 2 draft releases, so I could have them ready and declutter my notes. Today, I finalized 11 more rooms, with 18 to go. I expect to be able to publish the next set of releases on either Friday, March 5th 2021 (tomorrow) Saturday, March 6th 2021 (2 days from now) or Sunday (March 7th 2021) depending on how much I can do. It will not get delayed past March 10th.

I referenced my PhD in PHP project in the code-distancing project, so I decided to modernize that a little bit as well. I worked on mny projects today. I still didn't get as much done as I wanted to, but I got a lot done. I stayed up with my work past 10:07 pm to get all this done.

Today was a good day for development.

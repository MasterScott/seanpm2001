### Status update: March 9th 2021

I had a good day again today. I spent a long time playing BIt City, then I finished my journal early (notes accumulate for the rest of the day, night, and morning the next day, then I write again) 

I worked on various projects today, and wrote a lot of documentation. I also wrote 2 project Wikis, it was a lot easier to do today.

I have made some new changes to my daily schedule. They include:

* Image files have to be renamed before laptop shutdown

* Light Mode and Dark mode uploads for GitHub images will now be uploaded daily

I got my network location set up on my laptop today without installing Samba, however it used up too much CPU, so I had to turn it off

My keyboard had issues again today, but it is in waves. It goes from highly unresponsive gradually to perfect, then gradually back to highly unresponsive all day. I have tried brushing it out 7 times, and it still does this.

I got a lot of work done on the ProTraApp project again today.

Today was another good day for development.

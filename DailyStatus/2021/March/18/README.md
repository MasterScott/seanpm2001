### Status update: March 18th 2021

I got a good nights sleep last night and woke up early.

This morning when booting up my laptop, I thought there was a pixel out on my screen. I later found out it was just something stuck to the screen. This issue shouldn't happen this early anyways, but it immediately reminded me of the "Weird" Al Yankovic video "first world problems"

```al-yankovic
Oh no, there's a pixel out in the corner of my laptop screen
```

It wasn't in the corner of the screen for me btw.

Today, I had some time outside and had a recovery period after `[REDACTED]` this redacted info will be released on May 14th 2040 (possibly sooner, I have lessened my requirements a bit lately) 

I discovered the useful of Firefoxs built-in screenshot tool last night, and I used it again today. I was considering doing an extra 4 steps for every screenshot task (an uncropped light/dark mode version, a panoramic light/dark mode version) but it ended up using too much memory and time, so I decided to abandon it. I may do it occassionally, the profile panorama was cool, but it almost ended my current session, due to RAM usage jumping to `7.3 GiB/7.4 GiB` and SWAP `1.5 GiB/2.0 GiB`

I did renovations to the .github folder again today, updating 6 repositories took over 3 hours and drained my entire battery (my laptops battery is already failing) I have reached the end of the current capabilities of improvement to this directories, 

My legal grandparents are leaving for Hawaii and I have prepared notes for taking care of the house while they are gone. We have been planning this for a couple months.

I really hope I get back to actual programming again soon, I keep losing control of my normal workflow. I feel like I am getting close to finishing up.

I was unable to finish naming image files tonight, so I saved it for tomorrow.

Today was an OK day for development.

### Status update: March 16th 2021

I had difficulty waking up today, and I had to go to 2 consecutive appointments first thing today. I have never been this tired before, and this lingering tiredness lasted all day. I feel that it may have temporarily gotten rid of my social anxiety.

The appointments went well. Today on GitHub, I continued further default work on image repositories, and sponsor button setup + discussion and issue archival. I also wrote 4/5 of a project Wiki.

I have been a little slow on work today, due to so m&ny del&ys &nd &lso becausse my A &nd S keys &re ($till) h&ving problems &g&in tod&y. If you couldn't tell, I &m repl&cing A with &mpers&nd (&) due to issues with the specified key$ (&long with doll&r $ignss ($) for S) The S key issn't as b&d, although it does repeat alaot. I am currently showing you the unfixed version of wh&t my typing i$ currently like. I h&ve $uffered aa lot with my l&ptops keybo&rd l&tely, &nd I still caan't get it fixed. I really didn't want to get to the point of h&ving to show this online before 2040, but I promise I won't replace characters like this in my source code or other documentation. You can fix this by find&ng and repl&cing the 2 specified characters and also by fixing repe&ts m&nually.

I cre&ted 4 new org&niz&tions tod&y, for sever&l different projects. I h&ve been in ~~&~~ a less good mood today. I got a decent amount of work done, but I hope to return to normaal again, with whatever normal maay be.

Not much w&s done with programming today, I really want to resume full-on programming work again, but I still h&ve some things to get out of the way first.

Today was an OK day for development.

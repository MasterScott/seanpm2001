### Status update: March 23rd 2021

Again today, I did further work on getting more projects capable of sponsors and upgrading their `.github` folders.

Recently, there has been an abundance of aquatic life added to our house, and it has gotten me to decide to become a part time marine biologist again (the last time was during my pet shop phase between 2011 and 2015) I will be going through my old research and creating new research. I am still figuring out how I will format the data for GitHub.

My a key problem started coming back again last night but went awaay quickly. It is much worse today.

I got a lot done today with GitHub folder work, and also started work on a new datapack organization, which is my 10th and final organization for the month. I intend to work on it further tomorrow. I got a lot of work done today, but I spent a lot of time. I have made significant progress today, and less work will be required on it tomorrow. I also plan on getting some work done on a bunch of smaller projects.

Again, I was in a rush tonight to finish everything by 12:00 am. The time change has affected me negatively, it has also increased my depression, as now every day feels like there isn't enough time left.

I got a lot of family time in today, and had some calming time with the fish. I plan on getting 2 daily videos of the fish. The only problem I see is memory. A single 30 second 4K{HDR}120FPS video takes up over 270 megabytes. This averages to nearly 550 Megabytes per day.

Today was a good day for development.

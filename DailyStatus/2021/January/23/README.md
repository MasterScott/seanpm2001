### Status update: January 23rd 2021

I got very little done again today. I haven't been able to do anything but the basics recently. I found out what happened last night. Today I was diagnosed with a fever. Normally you get really cold during a fever, but for my instance, I just got really hot. I was able to recover by 4:00 pm, less than 24 hours from the start of the fever. I still wasn't able to get much done after recovery, but I started a repository for a Minecraft world I was working on today in my spare time.

Today was a bad day for development.

### Status update: January 29th 2021

Today I didn't do much. I was distracted and in a lot of pain tonight. I also wrapped up extra early, as I went to do something special: I went and camped out with my papa in our barn for the night. It was really nice.

I mostly got the usual basic work done tonight. I didn't do much else.

I learned something new with Markdown today, which is how to define a language in a code snippet. I will do a few demonstrations below:

**Python 3**

```python
# Comment
print ("Hello world")
x = int(2)
y = int(16)
print (x ** y)
""" Block comment 1 """
''' Block comment 2 '''
for i in range(1, 7):
	print (x / y)
	i == i + 1
def function()
	print ("No functionality in this function")
```

**Ruby**

```ruby
# Comment
puts "hello world"
```

You can view the source of this comment to learn how to do it yourself. Basically, all you have to do is put the name of the language (example: python) after a space after the 3 backticks ` ` ` that form a code comment

Today was an ok day for development.

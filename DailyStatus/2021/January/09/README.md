### Status update: January 9th 2021


To start off: I am not going to edit yesterdays entry, but I completely forgot to mention something yesterday, so I will put it here. I forgot to mention that while writing software for smart TVs, I got to learn BrightScript a lot better and got comfortable with programming in that language. It wasn't too difficult to learn due to its similarities with JavaScript and Visual Basic, both of which I have experience with. The current major thing I don't get about the language is what the program looks like before and after the compiling process, as I have no way of testing that my scripts/code worked. I am hoping that the (mostly) Visual Basic syntax I used was valid.

I had some issues today and didn't really know what to do in the end, so I went to bed slightly earlier. Today, I tried to get some work done, but I didn't plan out much to do. I had to skip my journaling today due to some issues. I have been making some decisions and planning out work in the background.

One of my new plans is to create a set of UNIX repositories for my desktop environment. For a non-personal project, I am working on tightening the algorithmic structure of SNU to try and mitigate further hate speech whack-a-mole, as I didn't account for it to be this bad when I started the mega p2p project. I am considering on making a mandatory hate speech filter, as hate speech really isn't necessary in life, no site should be reliant on it. It contributes nothing and in general is just bad. I originally planned on having hate speech filters, but now I am considering making them mandatory and non-opt out for publishing a SNU distribution, even with external forks. I am also considering who can edit them and how they can edit them, to prevent dog whistles and actual hate speech being permitted in the filter. I am also considering more smart TV programming, as it was fun doing that yesterday.

Today was a decent day for development.

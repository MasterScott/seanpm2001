### Status update: January 26th 2021

I have had some issues working today. I woke up really late, and didn't get to work until past 4:00 pm. I got the usual work done, along with file system organization, which made me feel productive, despite not really doing anything. I just haven't been knowing what to do lately. I have been trying to work on finalizing 16 small image repos, but I am hesitant to do it, as I get tired of writing the README files very quickly. There is still the publishing, tweaking, and forking that has to be done. I am only on step 4 of 10. I tried to get myself to focus to do it tonight after catching up on my journaling (2 days behind) but I just didn't have the interest, so I only wrote a daily status. Wednesday is the only day until Friday where I have a chance to get a lot done on it, I hope I do better tomorrow.

Today was an OK day for development. I again hope to try and do better tomorrow. I really have had too many bad days in a row.

### Status update: January 16th 2021

I forgot to mention in yesterdays update a little disappointment I had. I experimented and set up a sponsor button in my profile repo [seanpm2001/seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001) (the current repository) but it didn't put a sponsor button on my profile. That would be a nice feature for the future.

Regarding the sponsor button, I currently don't have Patreon fully set up, so I can't receive money. The button is only a vanity object at the moment.

I got to work on several projects today, and managed to start work on Candroid, but I didn't get as far as I wanted to with it. I still need ideas for how to continue the project. If I can't start working on the project in better detail soon, I am likely going to go back to making project wikis and doing Meadows and SNU development.

Today was a better day for development.

### Status update: January 8th 2021

I resumed normal work today, but didn't get as much done as I wanted. I dealt with some minor medical issues today. I got to do some actual programming for once today. It felt nice, I mostly worked on writing software for ethical smart TV services and programming IDEs.

I am starting to add in a label to projects today that I found, from the FSF (Free Software Foundation) that labels my projects DRM free. Again, this is something I would have liked to have found before creating 700+ repositories, but I am going to start adding it into as many projects as possible and displaying it in the README

Today was a good day for development.

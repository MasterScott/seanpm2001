### Status update: January 15th 2021

I didn't get as much done today as I wanted. I woke up really early today, and I had so much time, yet I got so little done. I shut down with a little depression due to this tonight. I could have kept going tonight, but I just didn't have the motivation.

I was going to continue work on Candroid today, I planned for the project to be a tri-language project (have 3 official project languages) but I didn't have the motivation to start tonight.
 
Today was a bad day for development.

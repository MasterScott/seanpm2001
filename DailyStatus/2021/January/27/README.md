### Status update: January 27th 2021

I had another average day with development today, however late tonight, I managed to finalize work on the `README.md` files for 16 projects I have been finalizing. I did 16 commits on this today. It wasn't too tedious tonight, and I consider my work successful. I hope to finalize either tomorrow or Friday, possibly with 8 projects at a time or more.

I spent a lot less time on my Wednesday games today, but I have had an increase in casual break time, playing a lot of Hill Climb Racing and Minecraft. This was due to an issue that started last night.

Last night at 6:00 pm, my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE was force-updated from Android 10 to Android 11. Upon discovery at past 8:30 pm, I hated most of the interface changes, and the decrease in performance. Later that night, I tried opening Tiny Tower, to find that Android 11 broke compatibility for the app. The app auto crashed and wouldn't stay loaded for more than 3 seconds. I wasn't able to play tonight, breaking a nearly 2 year tradition, and breaking my 600+ consecutive day streak, all because my phone was auto-updated without my permission. This has further leveraged my strong hate for Google. Due to this, I am giving less time to my phone, so that a message can be sent, even if it is really small. I am going to have to wait a while for NimbleBit to produce an update supporting Android 11. My phone has lost lots of functionality, and now I am starting to hate it. It used to be my best device, but now it has a worse battery, an even worse interface, and decreased functionality. This is going to further my process on degoogling, and hopefully motivate me enough to get a really good Android virtual machine going, so I can replace my phone entirely when ready.

I didn't do very much today. A lot of my projects are queued due to the 16 projects that are being finalized. Hopefully I play games less tomorrow, and can make more progress on the 16 projects, despite the Thursday schedule. I have also been trying to plan out new ways to get myself out there and start my career. I am currently considering doing a whole bunch of community collaboration on projects that aren't my own. I just don't know where to start right now.

Today was an good day for development.

### Status update: January 11th 2021

I didn't get much done today. I dealt with a stomach bug all day, along with a lack of sleep, so I have been really out of it. Due to this, I intend to change my schedule and go to bed much earlier, instead of going to sleep past 1:00 am.

I didn't do much today, mostly just my daily work. I am starting to work on getting back into the development of my open source Minecraft alternate, but I feel bad for modifying it so much, as it is my first GitHub repository, and it has a lot of nostalgia tied to it.

Today was a bad day for development.

### Status update: January 12th 2021

I didn't get much done again today. I got nearly 12 hours of sleep last night, yet I was still really tired today. I did my usual work, and made sure not to miss anything today, I am starting to get into the GitHub discussion feature. I feel it will be really useful for comments that don't require raising an issue or pull request.

I worked on various projects today, but didn't get too much done. I am hoping tomorrow will be better.

I have moved my conversation about SNU Hate speech filters to the appropriate repository today. You can see the continued discussion that started January 9th 2021 to January 10th 2021 [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_HateSpeechFilters/discussions/2).

Today was another bad day for development.

### Status update: January 25th 2021

Yet again, I got very little done today. I haven't been doing too well lately.

I got the usual projects done, but not much more. I wasn't able to finish my journaling today, so I saved it for tomorrow. I did get work done on making 5 days of status updates, as I fell behind.

I had an appointment with my therapist today, we haven't seen each other since October of 2019. We did a video conference via ClockTree, as I chose it over Zoom. I have become attached to my 360p webcam now, and I want to make more use of it now. The camera is so low quality that I mostly look like a silhouette that is very pixelated when in picture in picture. I like it this way.

Today was another bad day for development. I hope to try and do better tomorrow. I have had too many bad days in a row.

### Status update: January 28th 2021

I had a pretty good day with development today. I got the usual work done, and also managed to finalize the 16 projects I have been trying to finalize for a while. I was able to do this, despite today being a Thursday, and waking up late. I have reduced the amount of gameplay time I can have lately, and I have been getting more done because of it. I am surprised I was also able to do so much despite forgetting to eat until past 6:00 pm today. These projects were held back very far, it took me over 3 months, but I managed to finish them today. I started in the first half of November 2020, did a lot of procrastination, but finished them. There are some more small image projects to be done, but I am nearly all caught up now.

The projects are done, so I am going forward with more projects in my queue. The next project I started work on today was a project I conceived this week, which is a tool for smart toothbrushes that manages many dental tasks, and motivates and helps people brush their teeth. It is another one of my contributions to open source health projects. I was inspired to start it after I began brushing my teeth on a daily basis again (if you are interested, I have kept it consecutive for about 14 days now) I feel like this project will help motivate people to brush their teeth and care for their teeth more.

I got a lot done today. Thursdays are no longer considered bad for me now, as I have completely changed how I operate on these days, and can now be successful.

Today was a very good day for development.

### Status update: January 5th 2021

My workflow is starting to get light. I didn't have as much to do again today, so I started to write notes on things I didn't finish last year. I am writing this status update a day late, as I felt too intoxicated/tired to write the message.

Today, I published less releases, and worked on the usual Tuesday projects. My day in general was a little stressful today, but it was a lot better than yesterday.

Today was an OK day for development.

### Status update: January 21st 2021

I had a decent day with development today. I didn't get much done other than the usual Thursday work, however I did resume work on trying to wrap up 16 image repositories. I made 5 `README.md` files, but then lost interest and quit for the night. I also started a repository for mari0 backup data. My custom map pack is now public.

Today was an OK day for development.

### Status update: January 17th 2021

I got to do some higher level programming today. I got work done in various projects today, and quit a bit earlier than expected.

I got to do a lot more work with Candroid today, although I am still trying to figure out how the package manager is going to be designed. I have been stuck on the idea for 3 days. I have applied the DRM Free label to more projects, and embedded it into a second project today. I have also been starting discussions on every repository I can, as that way there is a better way of communicating on projects.

My old phone is starting to fail completely now. I am going to have to retire it soon. This is likely to free up 40-70 minutes of time in the day for me.

Today was a good day for development.

### Status update: January 30th 2021

I have not had much time today. I really overplayed the 2 games I play on Saturday, ruining my schedule. I got work done later into the night.

Today, I crashed my laptop, as I was being a bit careless. I was using about 1.5 GiB of SWAP space, and 7.0/7.4 GiB of RAM, and I didn't check the monitor again before the crash. I went to open an image I just downloaded to see why it was over 60 megabytes in size. I knew I screwed up at that point, as my computer became unresponsive, and logged me out. Since I was too low on memory, every attempt to log back in just caused the login screen to refresh, so I restarted. I lost my GNOME System Monitor progress, and had to recreate 1 file, which I did successfully.

My laptop has a different behavior for each out of memory crash.

I have been making considerations for the month about expressing my Political beliefs online, as they have to come out at some point. I feel that the people I will upset with this information are people I won't want to communicate with anyway. I will still have my political filter, and I won't let politics spill out of their repositories, unless absolutely necessary. There won't be too many projects affected by this.

I didn't play Minecraft today other than to backup and do photography. I also didn't have the time to play Tiny TOwer again tonight. My phone did another forced update today, so I am hoping it didn't break it again. I will eventually find time to play Tiny Tower again.

Today was an ok day for development.

### Status update: January 13th 2021

I didn't get too much done today, but my schedule was doing better. Today, I worked on the usual projects, but also got back into Meadows development. I can't keep waiting for a good quantum computer language, so I am guessing that Python is compatible on quantum computers, as I heard of Java being usable on a quantum computer. I started the actual programming of Meadows today, but it seemed a lot less soul-less than what I planned it to be. A lot of work is going to need to be done to improve it.

I didn't do much else today.

Today was a good day for development, mostly due to the huge step started today, but other than that, it was a little unproductive.

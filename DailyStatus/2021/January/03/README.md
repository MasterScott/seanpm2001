### Status update: January 3rd 2021

I had a good day with development today. My project for creating a laptop that meets my needs gained a lot of work today, as I have had ideas for it for a couple days. I wrote nearly 65 Kilobytes of HTML for it. I am hoping to eventually settle this under-powered laptop issue.

I also got my first good engagement on GitHub from [NihalKarne](https://github.com/NihalKarne) who read my [GitHub issue](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Advanced_Eye_Chart/issues/1) on my Advanced Eye Chart project, I am so glad to finally have someone interacting with me and my projects here, I have put so much work, it is nice to finally see someone showing interest. Thank you to Git@NihalKarne you made my day today.

I was pretty distracted today, but I still got a lot of work done.

Today was a good day for development.

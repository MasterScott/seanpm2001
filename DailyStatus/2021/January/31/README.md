### Status update: January 31st 2021

My procrastination and focus has been getting worse lately. I was able to get some done today, and I made some major advancements for some projects, but I didn't get as much done as I wanted, and I had to skip my journaling tonight, holding it off for tomorrow.

I noticed near 9:00 pm that part 2 of my GitHub work hadn't even been started. I was considering holding it off for tomorrow, but I didn't want to strain myself further tomorrow, so I did as much as I could tonight, and managed to finish before 10:00 pm.

I have made 3909 commits in January 2021.

Today was a good day for development.

### Status update: January 22nd 2021

I had some difficulty sleeping again. I woke up at around 4:00 am, and wasn't able to get back to sleep until around 6:16 am, then got back to sleep up until 8:38 am. Despite getting less than 8 hours of sleep today, I was more functional than I expected. However, I got very little done today, and was very distracted later on. I only did the basics.

Later in the night, I started to get severely overheated, and dysfunctional.

Today was a bad day for development.

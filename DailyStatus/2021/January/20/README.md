### Status update: January 20th 2021

I didn't get very good sleep last night. I woke up at around 2:00 am, took nearly 2 hours to get back to sleep, then had my other half of sleep. Despite getting over 8 hours of sleep, I was still really tired and out of it tonight.

Today, I got work done across various projects. I came up with a new idea for a project last night, and I implemented it today. It is my first external programming library. Its purpose is to regulate what counters overflow to, so that when an integer overflow (or underflow) happens, it doesn't go to an unreasonable number. It is going to be more advanced, but I was only able to make a basic start to it today. I was out of it, and the writing was a bit shotty. I was too tired to write well today.

I started more work on SNU Programming Tools today, and did usual image uploads, but I didn't do much else today. I am hoping tomorrow will be better.

Today was an OK day for development.

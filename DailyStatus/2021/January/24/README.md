### Status update: January 24th 2021

I got little done again today besides the basics. I got a few small projects done, such as a `README` for the Plants vs. Zombies 2 image repo, Minecraft backup data for a new world and pictures, and a coinfarm level list for my Tiny Tower repo. I didn't get any programming work done, or any work towards the 16 repositories I have been trying to finish. I forgot to mention that I also recently (on January 22nd 2021) wrote a question on the Mozilla support forum about Firefox memory usage, as I wanted to get involved there.

Today was another bad day for development.

### Status update: January 1st 2021

Today was my first day for January 1st 2021, and I started with a clean slate for the day. I am now in control again for how many commits is considered bad or good in my bad progress monitor (commit count is just an indicator, it isn't the best measure of how much work got done)

I started to work on finalizing some projects, and preparing annual 2021 releases, so a lot of the commits today were just of me deleting `IGNORE.md` files, doing my usual uploads and post edits, and posting release data. I didn't do much else today.

Today was a good day for development.

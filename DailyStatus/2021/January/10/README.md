### Status update: January 10th 2021

An update on my plans for SNU hate speech filters

Unfortunately, I might have to let up on this. After some decision, I have noted that hate speech is a pretty grey area, and unless the definitions are 100% perfect and unbreakable on the first go (100% impossible) then I have no control. I don't want to be too restrictive, but I will still help domain owners (like AWS) with tools that can identify and warn/restrict users of bad hate speech platforms, but I might have to lessen my stance. This is going to take a lot more decision. I am now deciding on making the filters strongest for highly illegal and immoral content, but I still don't have control to stop all high level hate speech. 

Further discussion will happen in an upcoming related repository. If the repository still does not exist, remind me by January 15th 2021 (earliest date)

I had a casual day today. I am working on recovery on regaining some of the basics of life. I got to go outside today for nearly an hour, it was really calming. I am really wired tonight while writing this, so hopefully my syntax is correct. What I am getting at is that I didn't spend too much time working on GitHub. I woke up late today with lots of regrets of my history of "edgy" and cringy YouTube comments from over 3 years ago. I intend to archive these comments, link to their origin, and everything else before I delete my YouTube account in the future. These comments have been stressing me out for a number of years. In mu opinion, 80+ percent of my YouTube comments are bad. Back in 2017 and 2018, I was trying to become a "comment section god" like `Justin Y.` or `hmm yes interesting` this decision was very stupid, and I made lots of stupid comments. This is something I am going to have to suffer with for the rest of my life.

Tonight, I was casually browsing through my 32+ Gigabyte Reddit media folder, and I found an image related to the [gaslight galactica]() project. I have been looking for this image for months, and I casually found it this evening. I also cleared up some of my browser tabs, as I had 2 maxed out sessions, and I was needing to add more.

Today was a decent day for development.

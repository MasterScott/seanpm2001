### Status update: January 2nd 2021

I went on a trip to Tri-Cities today in the morning. It was a nice trip, but my impulsive gaming session ruined most of the experience for me. It wasn't a bad trip, I had a good time, I just didn't spend as much time looking out the window.

Today, I continued to finalize more projects and prepare more annual 2021 releases. I ran out of time today and couldn't finish 4 projects that I wanted to finish. I will save that for tomorrow.

Today was a good day for development.

### Status update: January 19th 2021

I didn't do very much today. I woke up late today due to issues with my schedule, and didn't get on my laptop until over an hour later than the usual.

Today, I took a lot of downtime, but I made the accomplishment of finishing the writing of project wikis for 16 projects. It was extremely difficult, as I was really irritated at the time, and programs were behaving inefficiently (VLC kept popping up to the foreground while i was working, something it should NOT do by default) and entering file names was inefficient, as I had to type `project_langu` instead of just `proj` because the recommended queries were things like `project_lang.d` `project_lang.e` etc. It would be a nice small feature if Firefox let you remove certain query suggestions manually or with macros. It would have made this a lot less difficult tonight.

I still have work to do on finalizing these projects. Other than the usual work, and wiki work, I didn't do much today.

Today was a decent day for development.

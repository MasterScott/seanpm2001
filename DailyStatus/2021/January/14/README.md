### Status update: January 14th 2021

I got a lot done today in various projects, but at the same time, not too much was done. I have a huge list of tasks now and I am working on as many as I can simultaneously. Since today was a Thursday, it was hard to get more done. I am also working on starting discussions on more projects.

In the end, it seemed all over the place, but I got a lot done today. I even got time to make status updates. I held off yesterdays, and almost forgot to do both today. I have much more planned for when I have the time. I also get to go to bed a bit earlier tonight.

A small decision is being made tonight, that is what the main language of Candroid will be. The 3 options I have are:

* Java

* Python

* Go

This decision will motivate me to work on the project more.

Today was a good day for development.

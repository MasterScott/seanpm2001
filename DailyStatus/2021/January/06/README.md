### Status update: January 6th 2021

My workflow is REALLY starting to get light. I didn't have as much to do again today, so I am going to start doing the tasks from my notes soon.

Today, I observed the big event of the United States for the day, this took a lot of time out of my work, but I hardly had any work anyway, I finished the first part of my work over 4-8 hours earlier than expected. I worked on the SNU Programming Tool repository today, adding support for 3 new languages. I also did a lot of `README.md` work today.

I am expecting a lot of work tomorrow, since I have to publish 14 releases and work heavily on 7 projects. Today was a lighter day, as it is a Wednesday, but tomorrow might be a challenge again. After tomorrow, I am going to try to resume pre-2021 work again.

Today was an OK day for development.

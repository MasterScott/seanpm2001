### Status update: January 4th 2021

I had a really difficult morning today, with indescribable amounts of pain for hours. I only got less than 6 hours of sleep last night. I have been really distracted all day, and I made little progress. To further the salt on the wounds, Khan Academy removed one of their best incentives with no prior notice, and now I question why I should even still use it, but I still am prepared to keep going until December 31st 2021 before I can decide on canceling my daily usage or not.

Today was really hard, and I didn't get too much done.

Today was not a very good day for development.

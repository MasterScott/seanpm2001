### Status update: April 15th 2021

I am back today. I don't feel fully comfortable yet with my misconfigured setup, but I am getting used to it. I am really getting fond of this laptop.

I was really tired while working last night and have been failing on doing my most basic daily tasks. Today, I finally got caught up on the work I have been unable to get to lately. I also grabbed the opportunity and made the `Year-of-the-Linux-desktop` organization, which will have heavily Linux-related projects.

I still was a bit slow today, and I am still stressed about hard drive related issues. I have not been willing to test the 2nd dongle to see if it was a dongle-related issue causing hard drive and other external device errors.

I had a much better day with development today, and I managed to finalize some work. I hope to try and do project work tomorrow, although I have some games I like to play on Fridays, and I have guests coming over, so I might be booked.

Today was a good day for development.

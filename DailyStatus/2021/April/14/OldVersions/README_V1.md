### Status update: April 14th 2021

Today was a very difficult day for development. I spent nearly 3 hours sorting pictures this morning, before starting my gaming sessions. I was so out of it last night that I fell asleep on the armchair last night, unable to make it to my own bed. I don't know how I ended up there.

I have been doing documentation work all over the place today after finishing sorting Reddit media and completing my short gaming sessions. I have limited music to listen to on my backup laptop right now, which makes work difficult.

Today was my first full day of backup laptop usage. I had to call tech support twice today, first for the issues with the other laptops keyboard (which is expected to get repaired on April 17th 2021) and also to try and find out about the error `System program problem detected` meanwhile during the call, I found that after making a backup of some data on my old laptop, my new laptop was refusing to mount the hard drive. The issue got worse when I found out both Linux laptops couldn't mount the laptop. It became a panic, and I am sorry to tech support if my upsetness was shown on the call. This has been a deathly fear for 5 years, and it finally occurred today. It is going to add constant stress until I get a backup of the backup (3.6 TB) luckily it isn't the drive that is the problem, as the drive is fully functional on a Windows device with a USB port without a dongle.

This issue caused lots of suffering today, lately, everything wrong has been happening, and I have dealt with more and more severe errors every day. It has been a nightmare today. I tried to distract myself, but it kept coming up. Later on, I tried to copy data from an SD card on the dongle on the first laptop again, and the moment I tried to copy a second stream of files at once, it got severely corrupted and made the file system read-only for some reason. This caused further panic, and I can now further rule the dongle may be a problem after tech support. I honestly need more people from my own world of thinking (people who are highly technically savvy) to help me out, but I can't find anyone.

I did some note work on GitHub today, along with some of the usual tasks, except I skipped the `GitHub-daily` (Git-image) work again today.

I have been working on fixing my schedule lately, and it has gotten too out of control, so I had to give up on it again today. I will try to get it under control again starting Sunday.

Today was not a very good day for development.

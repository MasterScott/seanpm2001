### Status update: April 28th 2021

I had a good day today. I had a very long set of gaming sessions this morning before starting work, and I enjoyed my work a bit more today. I worked further on the SVG video project, and also some other projects, such as SNU Translate, and LinkLax.

I torrented a couple files today, archive.org appears to be a safe place to torrent from, as the only peers are web seeds, and not random Internet users. I am still not going to do anything "illegal" though.

I had continued issues with my laptops battery today, but they weren't as severe. I would like to promote VLC for Android for those who can't degoogle and are stuck with a Samsung ROM, as VLC for Android is really incredible. The desktop version has a lot of functionality, but it nearly at par on the mobile version, there are some pros that the PC version doesn't have, like the scanning and parsing/guessing of your songs with high accuracy (without having to reference the Internet) it can tell the genre of all your music somehow. It has really good control, and I have genuinely been enjoying the experience lately. Please note that I am not affiliated with VideoLan, but I wouldn't mind an affiliation.

So lately, on GitHub, I have been focusing on 4 things:

1. Making more quality commits

2. Working on the listing of my top 25 projects of the month

* 1. Pushing /politics as far to the bottom as possible, since I don't want to be known solely for it

* 2. Getting projects on the list with more and more commits, so that as many projects as possible have 100 or more commits without a loss in quality

Today was a good day for development.

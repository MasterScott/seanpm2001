### Status update: April 17th 2021

I had a good day with development today, although my world is still being turned upside down by technical problems. My new laptop didn't crash today, and I found out how much more helpful Linux is comparted to Windows on reporting errors. Linux gives you all the details, and additionally, I learned today that I can make the error redirect to a bug triage page about the issue. I would never have learnt this if I kept error reporting on by default.

I did the usual tasks today, and felt like I did a little bit more today. I was working quite a lot with SNU programming tools today, adding necessary libraries for languages, starting with a 2nd language (Inform) it is fun for me to do.

I started experimenting with the calming blue theme idea I had, but went in a different direction for now compared to the advanced features I had planned. You can see the theme in use on my later screenshots today. Yes, it does look tacky, this is just the first prototype. I am nicknaming it "Egypt B1" (B as in Blue, not Beta) because the zigzag pattern reminds me of Egypt for some reason. Currently, I am just experimenting with it psychologically, and seeing what colors work and what don't. I made sure not to include any yellow or red, as it is commonly associated with negativity (yellow as in error messages, such as ‚ö†Ô∏è red as in error messages üõë as well, along with low battery, and other stressors) I have noted that the menu (not shown in screenshots as of yet) is hard on my eyes, but for whatever reason is emitting a calming feeling to me. I don't know if it is my own bias or not. I will need to do further testing on this. Despite its tackiness, it still serves its purpose for me.

Based on review from one other person, an anonymous family member with vision problems, it has been noted that the green search bar is a problem as well. I never noted it to be a problem. Luckily, this is just a prototype, these issues can be worked out.

I stayed up really late again tonight, but got all my work done.

Today was a good day for development.

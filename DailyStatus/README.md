# README

This is an archive of my daily status posts on GitHub. I started writing these posts on an issue on my profile repository on December 22nd 2020, as I was having difficulty organizing myself, and this helped a bit.

A new issue is created each month and each reply is a status update for 1 day of the month.

Here are the current updates:
